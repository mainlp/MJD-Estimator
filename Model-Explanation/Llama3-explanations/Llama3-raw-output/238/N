You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: (And yes, he has said a few things that can, with some effort, be construed as support for supply-side economics.) 
Statement: It would take some work to construe the things as support for supply-side economics. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions that some things can be construed as support, but it does not specify what those things are, making it unclear if the statement is true or false.
* The context uses the phrase "with some effort", which implies that construing the things as support requires some work, but it does not explicitly state that it would take some work to construe them as such.
* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but it does not add any new information, making it unclear if it is true or false based on the provided context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if the things mentioned can be easily or hardly construed as support, making the statement's claim of "some work" being required uncertain.
* The statement's wording is vague, and "some work" can be interpreted in different ways, making it difficult to determine if the statement is true or false.<|eot_id|>
