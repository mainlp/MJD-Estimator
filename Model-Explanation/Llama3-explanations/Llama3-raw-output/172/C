* The subject "he" threw an object, not shot a gun.
* The phrase "shot the other" implies that "the other" is not a gun, but rather one of "them" (the objects).
* The context suggests that "he" used two different actions (threw and shot) on two different objects, making it unlikely that a gun was involved in both actions.
* The statement "He shot his gun" implies that the gun was the object being shot, which contradicts the context where "he" shot one of the objects.
* The context does not mention a gun being possessed by "he", making it unlikely that "he" shot his own gun.<|eot_id|>
