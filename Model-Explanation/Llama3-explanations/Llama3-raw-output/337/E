* The number of mail pieces lost is small, implying that mail is not often lost.
* The impact on First-Class volume is not material, suggesting that the frequency of lost mail is not significant.
* The context focuses on the effect of alternative bill-paying methods, implying that mail loss is an occasional exception rather than a common occurrence.
* The phrase "too small" emphasizes the infrequency of lost mail.
* The statement "not often" is a direct inference from the context, which implies that mail loss is an occasional event.<|eot_id|>
