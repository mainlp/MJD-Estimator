You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Generally, FGD systems tend to be constructed closer to the ground compared to SCR technology retrofits. 
Statement: FGD systems tend to replicate SCR systems.

* The statement does not provide any information about the relative proximity of FGD systems to the ground, which is the only aspect discussed in the context.
* The context only talks about the construction of FGD systems in relation to the ground, but the statement makes a claim about FGD systems replicating SCR systems, which is unrelated to the context.
* There is no mention of replication or similarity between FGD and SCR systems in the context, making it impossible to infer the truth of the statement.
* The context provides a contrast between FGD systems and SCR technology retrofits, implying they are different, but the statement claims they are similar, which is not supported by the context.
* The statement's meaning is unclear, as "replicate" could mean different things, such as identical, similar, or copying, and the context does not provide enough information to disambiguate the meaning.<|eot_id|>
