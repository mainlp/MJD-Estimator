* The statement explicitly mentions "clay" as the material, but the context states that the models are made of "wax".
* The context does not mention "clay" as a material used for the models.
* The context specifically highlights the material "wax", implying that it is the only material used or the most relevant one.
* The statement contradicts the context by introducing an alternative material ("clay") that is not supported by the context.
* The context does not provide any information that would suggest the presence of models made of clay.<|eot_id|>
