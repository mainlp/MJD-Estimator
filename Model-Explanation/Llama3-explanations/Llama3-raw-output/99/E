* Wax is a type of modeling material, and the statement mentions models, so it can be inferred that they have models made out of other materials as well, including clay.
* The context does not explicitly state that the models are only made of wax, leaving open the possibility that they have models made of other materials, such as clay.
* The Civic Museum may have a collection of models made from various materials, including clay, in addition to the wax models of the river gods.
* The statement is making a general claim about the museum's collection, and it is possible that they have models made of clay in addition to the wax models mentioned in the context.<|eot_id|>
