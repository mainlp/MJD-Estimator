* The context only mentions wax models, but not clay models, so it's unclear if they have clay models or not.
* The context is specific to the Civic Museum, but the statement is general, so it's unclear if "they" refers to the Civic Museum or some other entity.
* The context doesn't provide any information about the material of the models other than wax, so it's impossible to infer anything about clay models.
* The statement is too vague, it's unclear what "they" refers to, it could be the Civic Museum, the river gods, or some other entity.
* There is no logical connection between the context and the statement, so it's impossible to determine the truth value of the statement.<|eot_id|>
