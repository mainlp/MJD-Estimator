* The context does not mention an asteroid impact, only an ancient capital.
* There is no connection established between the ancient capital and an asteroid impact.
* The name "Thira" is shared, but it is not uncommon for different locations or entities to share the same name.
* The context provides information about the ancient capital, but not about an asteroid impact.
* The statement is making a claim about an asteroid impact, which is not supported by the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the site is an asteroid impact or not.
* There is no mention of an asteroid impact in the context, making it impossible to infer a connection.
* The statement is introducing new information not present in the context, making it impossible to determine its truth value.<|eot_id|>
