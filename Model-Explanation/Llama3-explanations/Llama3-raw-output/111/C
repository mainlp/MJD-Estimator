* The context mentions a "rocky outcropping" but does not imply an asteroid impact.
* The site is described as the "ancient capital of the island" which contradicts the idea of an asteroid impact.
* The context provides a specific date ("third century b.c.") and a historical context ("under Ptolemaic rule"), which is unrelated to an asteroid impact.
* The term "Thira" is used to refer to the ancient capital, not an asteroid impact.
* There is no mention of an asteroid or any catastrophic event in the context.<|eot_id|>
