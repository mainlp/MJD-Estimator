* The context describes a Zen temple rock garden as a place where recorded announcements are made, implying a gathering of people.
* The presence of loudspeakers suggests a need to communicate with a sizable audience.
* The fact that the tranquillity of the garden can be shattered implies that there are enough people present to disturb the peace.
