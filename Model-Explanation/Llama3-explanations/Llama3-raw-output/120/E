Statement: GAGAS requires strict compliance for auditors to follow.

* The statement is not explicitly supported by the context, and the context actually suggests the opposite, that auditors may not need to strictly follow GAGAS.
* The context only mentions that other standards and methodologies can serve as a useful source of guidance, implying that GAGAS may not be the only or primary standard to follow.
* There is no mention of strict compliance or any punitive measures for not following GAGAS, which would be expected if strict compliance was required.
* The tone of the context is permissive, suggesting that auditors have flexibility in their approach, rather than being required to strictly follow GAGAS.<|eot_id|>
