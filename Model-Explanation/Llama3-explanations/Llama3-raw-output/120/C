Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context implies that auditors may not follow other standards and methodologies, suggesting that GAGAS does not require strict compliance.
* The phrase "may still serve as a useful source of guidance" implies that GAGAS provides guidelines rather than strict requirements.
* The context does not mention any penalties or consequences for not following other standards and methodologies, which would be expected if GAGAS required strict compliance.
* The tone of the context is permissive, suggesting that auditors have flexibility in their approach, which is inconsistent with strict compliance.
* The context focuses on the usefulness of other standards and methodologies, rather than their mandatory nature, implying that GAGAS does not require strict compliance.<|eot_id|>
