Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions "additional tools to recover current overpayments" without specifying who the overpayments were made to.
* The statement specifically mentions "overpayments made to insurers", which is not explicitly supported or contradicted by the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the "additional tools" are intended to recover overpayments made to insurers or to other entities.
* The statement's scope is narrower than the context, focusing on "insurers" whereas the context is more general, making it difficult to determine entailment.
* The context does not rule out the possibility that the "additional tools" are intended to recover overpayments made to entities other than insurers.<|eot_id|>
