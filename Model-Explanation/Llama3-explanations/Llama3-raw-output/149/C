Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context only mentions "current overpayments" without specifying who received them, whereas the statement assumes the overpayments were made to insurers.
* The context does not explicitly state that the overpayments were made to insurers, whereas the statement makes this assumption.
* The context only mentions "additional tools" for recovery, but does not specify what kind of tools or who the recovery is from, whereas the statement assumes a specific type of tool and a specific entity (insurers).
* The context focuses on "current overpayments", implying that the recovery is for recent or ongoing overpayments, whereas the statement does not provide any temporal context.
* The context does not provide any information about the relationship between SSA and insurers, whereas the statement assumes a specific relationship (overpayments made to insurers).<|eot_id|>
