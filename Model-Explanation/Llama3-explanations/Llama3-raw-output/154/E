Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The absence of ancient sites in Mykonos implies that their presence is the reason for diving bans elsewhere.
* The fact that diving was never banned in Mykonos, which lacks ancient sites, suggests that ancient sites are the reason for diving bans in other locations.
* The contrast between Mykonos, where diving was not banned, and other places, where it was banned, implies that the presence of ancient sites is the cause of the ban.
* The phrase "after all, there are no ancient sites to protect" implies that the protection of ancient sites is the reason for diving bans in other places.
* The context suggests that the only reason diving was not banned in Mykonos is the absence of ancient sites, implying that ancient sites are the reason for diving bans elsewhere.<|eot_id|>
