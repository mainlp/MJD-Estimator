You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Mykonos has had a head start as far as diving is concerned because it was never banned here (after all, there are no ancient sites to protect). 
Statement: Protection of ancient sites is the reason for diving bans in other places. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context only implies a correlation between the absence of ancient sites and the lack of diving bans, but does not establish causation.
* The reason for diving bans in other places is not explicitly stated, and it might be due to other factors unrelated to ancient site protection.
* The context only talks about Mykonos, and it's possible that the reasons for diving bans in other places are different.
* The statement assumes that ancient site protection is the sole reason for diving bans, which might not be the case.
* There could be other reasons for diving bans in other places, such as environmental concerns, safety issues, or commercial restrictions.
* The context does not provide enough information to make a general statement about the reasons for diving bans in all other places.<|eot_id|>
