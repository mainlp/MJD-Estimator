* The context states that Herb Williams was supposed to take the place of Tarpley, implying that they are comparable in some way, but Tarpley being better offensively is not mentioned.
* The context explicitly states that Herb Williams "just doesn't have the offensive skills", implying that Tarpley might have those skills, but it's not a direct comparison.
* The context does not provide any information that would suggest Tarpley is better offensively than Herb Williams, it only mentions the lack of skills in Herb Williams.
* The context implies that Herb Williams is not a good replacement for Tarpley, which could be due to various reasons, not necessarily because Tarpley is better offensively.
* The speaker's tone and language used ("sort of", "i guess") convey uncertainty and hesitation, which might indicate that the speaker is not confident in their assessment of Tarpley's abilities.<|eot_id|>
