You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: But it just might be because he's afraid he'll lose his No. 
Statement: He's definitely afraid of losing he's No. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context implies that the reason for the subject's behavior is fear, and the statement explicitly states that fear.
* The phrase "it just might be" in the context suggests a possibility, which is confirmed by the statement as a definite fact.
* The context mentions "afraid he'll lose his No." which is a more specific and implicit expression of fear, and the statement makes it more general and explicit.
* The context provides a reason for the subject's behavior, and the statement directly asserts the emotional state (fear) that is driving that behavior.
* The statement is a more direct and confident expression of the idea presented in the context.<|eot_id|>
