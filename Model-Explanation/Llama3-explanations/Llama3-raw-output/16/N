You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The logic of analysis in case studies is the same 
Statement: The logic for the case studies is the same thing as in the data collection. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions the logic of analysis, but the statement talks about the logic for the case studies, which might be different.
* The context does not provide information about the relationship between the logic of analysis and the logic of data collection.
* The statement implies an equivalence between the logic for case studies and the logic of data collection, which is not supported by the context.
* The context only mentions the sameness of the logic of analysis, but it does not specify what it is the same as.
* The statement introduces a new concept (data collection) that is not mentioned in the context, making it unclear how it relates to the logic of analysis.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the logic for case studies is indeed the same as the logic of data collection.<|eot_id|>
