* The action recommended in the statement ("eat 5 fruit/veg per day") is unrelated to the action in the context ("revise policy and guidance").
* The topic of the statement (dietary recommendations) is unrelated to the topic in the context (defense policy).
* The statement does not provide any information about the Secretary of Defense or defense policy.
* The statement appears to be a generic health recommendation, rather than a specific recommendation related to the context.
* There is no logical connection between the context and the statement.
* The statement does not contradict or support the context in any way.<|eot_id|>
