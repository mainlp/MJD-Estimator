* The topic of the recommendation is policy and guidance, not dietary advice.
* The content of the recommendation is unrelated to eating fruit/veg per day.
* The tone and style of the recommendation are formal and official, unlike the informal tone of the given statement.
* The language and terminology used are specific to a government agency (GAO) and a government official (Secretary of Defense), which is not consistent with the given statement.
* The context implies a formal report or document, whereas the given statement appears to be a casual suggestion.<|eot_id|>
