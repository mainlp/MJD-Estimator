Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The context implies that the writer in question took liberties with the truth, so the opposite (being factual) is now required.
* The "kind of license" referred to in the context likely involves a lack of factuality and care, so its absence necessitates more factuality and care.
* The context suggests that the writer's behavior was unacceptable, and the only way to avoid such unacceptability is to be more factual and careful.
* The phrase "no longer allowed" implies that there are now stricter standards, which would require writers to be more factual and careful.
* The context implies that the writer's actions were not careful, so the opposite (being careful) is now necessary.<|eot_id|>
