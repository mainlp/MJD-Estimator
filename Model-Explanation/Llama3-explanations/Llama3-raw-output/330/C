* The statement is an inference, but the context only mentions "brave Dorcas" as a phrase used to address or introduce her, not as a description of her character.
* The context does not provide any evidence or examples of Dorcas' bravery.
* The context focuses on Dorcas' physical appearance, not her personality or actions.
* The phrase "brave Dorcas" might be ironic, sarcastic, or used in a humorous tone, rather than a genuine description of her character.
* Dorcas' behavior, such as standing with her hands folded, does not necessarily convey bravery.
* The context does not provide enough information to make a general claim about Dorcas' bravery.<|eot_id|>
