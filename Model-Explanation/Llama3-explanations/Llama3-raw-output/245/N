* The context only mentions that effective management determines a good return, but does not provide information about the DOD's management effectiveness.
* The context does not provide any information about the DOD's current or past performance in managing funds.
* The statement makes a claim about a bad return, but the context only discusses a good return, without providing any information about the opposite scenario.
* The context does not provide any evidence or hints that would suggest the DOD is likely to mismanage the funds.
* The statement's certainty ("is certain to") is not supported by the context, which only establishes a conditional relationship between management and return.
* The context does not provide any information about external factors that could affect the return on investment, which might influence the DOD's performance.<|eot_id|>
