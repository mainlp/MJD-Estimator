Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The policy's success was not the cause of the speaker's contribution to their people.
* The speaker's contribution to their people occurred before the policy's success.
* The speaker's contribution to their people was not a direct result of the policy's success.
* The speaker's contribution to their people was already made, and the policy's success was a separate event.
* The policy's success was not a necessary condition for the speaker to make a contribution to their people.
* The speaker's contribution to their people was not dependent on the policy's success.<|eot_id|>
