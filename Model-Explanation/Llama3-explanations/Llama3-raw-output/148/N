You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The policy succeeded, and I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to make that contribution to my people. 
Statement: Because the policy was a success, I was able to make a contribution to my people. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context does not explicitly state that the policy's success was the cause of the speaker's contribution, only that both events occurred.
* The context implies that the speaker's contribution was part of the policy, but it's unclear if the policy's success was necessary for the contribution to be made.
* The statement assumes a causal relationship between the policy's success and the speaker's contribution, but the context only provides a temporal relationship.
* The context focuses on the speaker's fortune in having the opportunity to make a contribution, rather than the policy's success being the direct cause of that opportunity.
* The statement's wording is similar to, but not identical with, the context, leaving room for alternative interpretations.<|eot_id|>
