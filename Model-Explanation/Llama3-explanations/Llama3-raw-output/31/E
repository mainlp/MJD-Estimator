Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* Warm air is often associated with arid conditions, so the warm air implies arid air.
* Arid air is more likely to permeate the surrounding land due to its dry and light properties, which are consistent with warm air.
* The warmth of the air suggests a lack of moisture, which is a characteristic of arid air that can permeate the surrounding land.
* The context does not mention any obstacles or barriers, so the warm air can freely permeate the surrounding land, and its arid nature is a plausible assumption.
* The phrase "the air is warm" implies a certain level of dryness, which is a key feature of arid air that can permeate the surrounding land.<|eot_id|>
