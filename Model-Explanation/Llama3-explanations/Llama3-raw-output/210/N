* The context only mentions "ceremonial purposes" without specifying the type of ceremonies, so it's unclear if funerals are included.
* The context mentions "journeys to the west bank" which might not necessarily involve funerals.
* The context does not explicitly state that the statues were moved to Luxor for funerals, only that they were moved to Luxor for some ceremonial purpose.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if "other ceremonies" refers to funerals or not.
* The statement is too specific (mentioning funerals) compared to the context which is more general (only mentioning ceremonial purposes).
* The context does not rule out the possibility that statues were moved to Luxor for other types of ceremonies, but it also does not confirm that funerals were one of them.<|eot_id|>
