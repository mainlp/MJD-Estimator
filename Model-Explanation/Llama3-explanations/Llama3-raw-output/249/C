* "Think" and "use your crazy mind" are equivalent, so the statement is a paraphrase of the context, but the context uses "don't" while the statement uses "do not", which are equivalent, so there is no contradiction.
* The context only prohibits thinking, but the statement prohibits using one's crazy mind, which might be a more specific or intense form of thinking, so the statement is not necessarily a contradiction.
* The context and statement have different wording, but the same meaning, so there is no contradiction.<|eot_id|>
