You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 3 It should be noted that the toxicity (LC50) of a sample observed in a range-finding test may be significantly different from the toxicity observed in the follow-up chronic definitive test  (1) the definitive test is longer; and (2) the test may be performed with a sample collected at a different time, and possibly differing significantly in the level of toxicity. 
Statement: The toxicity of a sample in the range-finding test will be exactly the same as the toxicity in the follow-up test. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

There are no possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context. The context explicitly states that the toxicity of a sample in the range-finding test may be significantly different from the toxicity in the follow-up test, citing two reasons for this difference. Therefore, the statement is actually a contradiction (contradiction) or a non-entailment.<|eot_id|>
