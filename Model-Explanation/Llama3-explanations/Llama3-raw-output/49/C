You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He dismounted and Ca'daan saw he was smaller than the rest. 
Statement: He was shorter than the others. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* "Smaller" refers to weight or build, not height.
* "Smaller" is a subjective judgment, and Ca'daan's perception is incorrect.
* "The rest" refers to a different group or category, not "the others".
* The comparison is not about physical characteristics, but about something else (e.g., social status, experience).
* The sentence "He dismounted" implies a non-human entity, and "smaller" is not applicable to it.
* Ca'daan's observation is based on a misleading or incomplete view (e.g., he only saw him from a distance).<|eot_id|>
