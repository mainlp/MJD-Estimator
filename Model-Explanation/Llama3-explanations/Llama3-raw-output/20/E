* The context implies that the newspaper receives multiple letters from readers, but only publishes one, suggesting a selection process.
* The phrase "just one letter a week" implies that there are more letters available than the one being published.
* The existence of an "editorial riposte" at the bottom of the published letter suggests that the editorial team is actively engaging with the submitted letters, implying a larger pool of submissions.
* The fact that a response is provided to the published letter implies that the editorial team has read and considered multiple letters before selecting one for publication.<|eot_id|>
