You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He threw one of them and shot the other. 
Statement: He kept his gun holstered. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context implies that "he" used a gun to shoot one of "them", so the gun was not holstered during the shooting.
* The statement is false, and the correct label is "contradiction" rather than "entailment".<|eot_id|>
