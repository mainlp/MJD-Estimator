Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The statement implies he didn't use his gun, but the context says he shot one of them.
* The context mentions "shot" which implies the gun was not holstered.
* If he shot one of them, it means he must have taken the gun out of the holster.
* The action of shooting is incompatible with the gun being holstered.
* The context describes two actions: throwing and shooting, which cannot be done with a holstered gun.<|eot_id|>
