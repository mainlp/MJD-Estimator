Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The Leal Senado is described as an "impressive" building, implying it is still standing and not in ruins.
* The context mentions entering the "cool entrance hall" of the building, which suggests it is still intact and not a ruin.
* The building is referred to as a "fine example of colonial architecture", implying it is well-preserved and not in a state of disrepair.
* The context does not mention any damage or destruction to the building, which would be necessary for it to be reduced to "old ruins".<|eot_id|>
