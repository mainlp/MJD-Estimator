Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context implies that the attackers will come from the south, which means the south is not protected against an attack.
* The context mentions that the attackers have a wide space to launch their attack, implying that the south is vulnerable to attack.
* The context does not provide any information that suggests the south is protected against an attack, making the statement false by omission.
* The statement contradicts the context's implication that the attackers will be able to launch an attack from the south.
* The context's mention of the attackers having a space to launch their attack implies that the south is not secure or protected against an attack.<|eot_id|>
