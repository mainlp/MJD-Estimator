* The context only states that marriage is important, but does not provide a clear indication of its level of importance, leaving room for interpretation.
* The term "crucial" is stronger than "important", but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the statement is true or false.
* The context does not provide a clear definition of what makes an institution "important" or "crucial", making it difficult to determine the truth value of the statement.
* The statement could be true, but the context does not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute it.
* The context only provides a general statement about marriage, but does not provide specific information about its role in society, making it difficult to determine if it is crucial.
* The term "crucial" implies a high level of necessity or importance, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if marriage meets this threshold.<|eot_id|>
