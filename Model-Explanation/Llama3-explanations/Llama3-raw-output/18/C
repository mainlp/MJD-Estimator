Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false (contradiction):

* The context only states that marriage is important, but not crucial.
* The context does not provide enough information to conclude that marriage is crucial to society.
* The term "important" in the context has a different connotation than "crucial" in the statement.
* The context only focuses on the institution of marriage, whereas the statement makes a broader claim about its impact on society.
* The context does not imply that marriage is essential or vital to society, which is what "crucial" implies.<|eot_id|>
