* The statement is an exaggeration, and the context implies that only a few high-value cards are included in each pack, not every rare card a kid could want.
* The context suggests that the manufacturer is trying to entice kids to buy more packs, implying that not every pack contains every rare card.
* The phrase "like lottery tickets" implies that the rarity of certain cards is what makes them desirable, and it's unlikely that every pack would contain every rare card.
* The context focuses on the manufacturer's strategy to encourage kids to buy more packs, which would be unnecessary if every pack contained every rare card.
* The statement is a hyperbole, and the context provides a more realistic understanding of the situation, which is that only a few high-value cards are included in each pack.<|eot_id|>
