* The statement implies that every pack has all rare cards, but the context suggests that only a few high-value cards are included to encourage kids to buy more packs.
* The context implies that the rarity of cards is used to motivate kids to buy more packs, which would not be the case if every pack had all rare cards.
* The statement suggests that kids can get all the rare cards they want in a single pack, but the context implies that the manufacturer is using the rarity of cards to encourage repeat purchases.
* The presence of "a few" high-value cards in the context contradicts the idea that every pack has every rare card a kid could want.
* The context implies that the distribution of rare cards is limited and unpredictable, like a lottery, which contradicts the idea that every pack has all rare cards.<|eot_id|>
