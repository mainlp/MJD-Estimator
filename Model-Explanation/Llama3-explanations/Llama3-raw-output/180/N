* The statement is an exaggeration, and the context only implies that some high-value cards are included, not every rare card.
* The context suggests that the manufacturer is encouraging kids to buy packs in hopes of getting rare cards, implying that not every pack contains every rare card.
* The statement is too absolute, and the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it.
* The context focuses on the manufacturer's strategy, not the actual contents of each pack.
* The statement contradicts the idea of buying packs like lottery tickets, which implies uncertainty and unpredictability.
* The context implies that the inclusion of high-value cards is a marketing tactic, but it does not guarantee that every pack contains every rare card.
* The statement is an overstatement, and the context only suggests that some packs may contain high-value cards, not that every pack contains every rare card.<|eot_id|>
