Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions that DSM-III-R is a revised edition of DSM-III, but it does not provide information about its content or scope.
* The context only mentions that Masochistic Personality Disorder was suggested for, but never made it into, the DSM-III-R, but it does not provide information about what is actually included in the DSM-III-R.
* The context does not explicitly state that DSM-III-R is a book of personality disorders, nor does it provide enough information to infer that it is not.
* The context focuses on the process of composing a criteria-set for a specific disorder, but it does not provide a general description of the DSM-III-R.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether DSM-III-R is exclusively a book of personality disorders or if it includes other types of disorders as well.<|eot_id|>
