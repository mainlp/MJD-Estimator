Context: Kutchins and Kirk cite a particularly amusing example of such  Robert Spitzer, the man in charge of DSM-III, was sitting down with a committee that included his wife, in the process of composing a criteria-set for Masochistic Personality Disorder--a disease that was suggested for, but never made it into, the DSM-III-R (a revised edition).

* DSM-III-R is a revised edition, not a book specifically focused on personality disorders.
* DSM-III-R is not a book that includes Masochistic Personality Disorder, which was suggested but not included.
* DSM-III-R is a broader psychiatric manual, not limited to personality disorders.
* The context implies that DSM-III-R is a revised edition of DSM-III, which suggests it covers a range of psychiatric disorders, not just personality disorders.<|eot_id|>
