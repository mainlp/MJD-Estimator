Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false (contradiction) given the context:

* The context is about a rule publication inviting comments, implying public participation and potential impact on the rule.
* The statement claims that one's vote won't make a difference, but the context suggests that comments (a form of public input) are being solicited, implying that individual contributions can influence the outcome.
* The context involves a formal process of collecting comments, which implies that the opinions and inputs of individuals are valued and can shape the final decision.
* The statement's pessimistic view of the effectiveness of individual votes is not supported by the context, which presents a more inclusive and participatory process.
* The context highlights the importance of public engagement, which contradicts the statement's assertion that individual actions (like voting) are futile.<|eot_id|>
