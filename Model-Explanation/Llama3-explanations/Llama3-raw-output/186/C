* The door has already been opened by Severn, so they didn't need someone to open it for them.
* Severn stepped out, implying they were already on the other side of the door, so they wouldn't be waiting for someone to open it for them.
* The context suggests Severn was the one who opened the door, not someone else, so they didn't need to wait for someone to open it.<|eot_id|>
