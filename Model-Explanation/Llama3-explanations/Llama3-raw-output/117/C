* The results were in line with random chance, implying no significant predictive power.
* The experiments did not produce conclusive evidence to support the claim of being a better predictor.
* The outcome of the experiments was neutral, neither confirming nor denying the predictive ability.
* The results were inconsistent or varied, failing to demonstrate a clear pattern or trend.
* The experiments were unable to establish a statistically significant correlation or causation.
* The data collected did not support the conclusion that it was a better predictor.
* The results were ambiguous, open to multiple interpretations, and did not provide clear evidence.
* The experiments lacked sufficient power or sample size to detect a significant effect.
* The methodology or design of the experiments was flawed, leading to inconclusive results.
* The results were susceptible to bias, confounding variables, or other sources of error.<|eot_id|>
