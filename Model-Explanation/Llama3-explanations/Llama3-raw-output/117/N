* The statement contradicts the context, which states that the results were in line with random chance, implying no significant prediction.
* The context does not provide any information about the experiments proving something to be a better predictor.
* The statement implies a positive outcome, but the context suggests a neutral or negative outcome (random chance).
* There is no mention of a specific "it" that the experiments proved to be a better predictor, making the statement unclear.
* The context focuses on the outcome of the experiments being in line with random chance, whereas the statement suggests a conclusive result.
* The statement's tone is positive and conclusive, whereas the context's tone is neutral or negative.<|eot_id|>
