Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions that New England Republicans led the party, but it does not provide information about their strength or weakness.
* The phrase "patrician manners were boons to a Republican" suggests that having a certain type of manner was beneficial, but it does not imply anything about the strength or weakness of New England Republicans.
* The context focuses on the social aspect of being a Republican (having patrician manners) rather than their political power or influence.
* There is no explicit contradiction or confirmation of the statement "New England Republicans were weak" in the context.
* The context is more descriptive of the environment in which Bush the elder came of age, rather than making a claim about the strength or weakness of New England Republicans.<|eot_id|>
