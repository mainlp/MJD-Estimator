Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only implies that he was worried and got distracted, but it does not explicitly state that he could not afford to get distracted.
* The context does not provide enough information about the consequences of getting distracted from his problem.
* The statement is a conclusion that can be inferred, but it is not directly supported by the context.
* The context only describes his mental state and actions, but it does not provide enough information about the importance or urgency of his problem.
* The statement is a subjective judgment that requires additional context or information to be determined as true or false.
* The context does not provide a clear cause-and-effect relationship between getting distracted and the consequences of doing so.<|eot_id|>
