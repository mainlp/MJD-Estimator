Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* He was already worried and thinking in circles, which implies distraction, and he had to pull himself back to his problem, indicating that distraction was not an option.
* The fact that he had to pull himself back to his problem suggests that he was prone to distraction, and therefore, he could not afford to get distracted.
* If he got distracted, he would continue thinking in circles of worry, which would hinder his ability to solve his problem.
* His problem required focus and attention, and distraction would prevent him from making progress or finding a solution.
* He recognized the negative impact of distraction on his problem-solving and deliberately pulled himself back, implying that distraction was not affordable.<|eot_id|>
