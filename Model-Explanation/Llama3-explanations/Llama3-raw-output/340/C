Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context implies he was already distracted, which contradicts the statement.
* The fact that he had to "pull himself back" suggests he was not focused on his problem, contradicting the statement.
* The statement implies he was able to maintain focus, but the context shows he was thinking in circles of worry, indicating distraction.
* The context describes him as being distracted (thinking in circles of worry), which is the opposite of what the statement claims.<|eot_id|>
