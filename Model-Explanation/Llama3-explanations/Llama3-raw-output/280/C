* The context only mentions meditation, not meditation learned from monks.
* The warriors may have already known meditation before arriving at the monastery.
* The warriors may have learned meditation from someone or something else, not the monks.
* The context does not explicitly state that the warriors learned meditation from the monks.
* The warriors may have simply meditated on their own without any guidance or teaching from the monks.
* The monks may not have taught the warriors meditation, but rather the warriors meditated independently in the monastery's rock garden.<|eot_id|>
