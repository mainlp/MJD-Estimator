Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context implies that IRS would have no record of time before the person could get through to an agent, but it does not rule out the possibility of recording time after getting through to an agent.
* The context only mentions the absence of records for discouraged callers, not all callers.
* The statement is too broad, as it claims there is no recording of time for any callers, whereas the context only discusses a specific scenario.<|eot_id|>
