* The context only mentions the Women's Haven, not "The Haven", so it's unclear if they refer to the same entity.
* The context only mentions the Women's Haven provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, but it doesn't imply that it's a useful resource in the community.
* The presence of a full-time attorney doesn't necessarily make the Women's Haven a useful resource in the community.
* The Women's Haven might be a useless or ineffective resource in the community despite having a full-time attorney.
* The Women's Haven might only cater to a specific demographic (domestic-violence victims) and not be a useful resource for the broader community.<|eot_id|>
