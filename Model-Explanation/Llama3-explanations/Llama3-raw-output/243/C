* The van was not new, it was almost brand new.
* The speaker did not get the van due to luck, but rather because they bought it from an estate trade.
* The speaker did not get the van, the gentlemen who owned it had died, implying someone else got the van.
* The van's newness is not the reason they got it, but rather the circumstance of the owner's death.
* The speaker is being sarcastic or ironic, and the statement is meant to be the opposite of what they truly mean.<|eot_id|>
