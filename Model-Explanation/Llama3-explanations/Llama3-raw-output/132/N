You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It lacked intelligence, introspection, and humor--it was crass, worthy of Cosmopolitan or Star. I do have a sense of humor, but can only appreciate a joke when it starts with a grain of truth. 
Statement: The article won a Pulitzer Prize.

* The context does not mention the article's quality or reception, making it impossible to infer whether it won a Pulitzer Prize or not.
* The context focuses on the article's lack of intelligence, introspection, and humor, but does not provide information about its awards or recognition.
* The speaker's personal sense of humor and appreciation for jokes with a grain of truth do not provide any insight into the article's Pulitzer Prize status.
* The comparison to Cosmopolitan or Star magazines does not imply anything about the article's awards or recognition.
* The context does not provide any information about the article's genre, topic, or style, which could be relevant to its Pulitzer Prize chances.
* The speaker's tone is critical, but this does not necessarily mean the article did not win a Pulitzer Prize; it may have won despite its perceived flaws.
* There is no explicit contradiction or confirmation of the article winning a Pulitzer Prize in the context.<|eot_id|>
