* The context only mentions one young lady, implying there was only one, but the statement refers to "the other young lady", suggesting there were multiple.
* The context describes the young lady as "most kind", but does not explicitly state that she gave a warm welcome.
* The context does not mention a welcome at all, let alone a warm one.<|eot_id|>
