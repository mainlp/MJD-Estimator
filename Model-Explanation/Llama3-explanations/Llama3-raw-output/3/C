Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The analysts wanted to loosen the old standards because they thought the market was overvalued, not to make it less restrictive for investors.
* The analysts wanted to loosen the old standards, but not to benefit investors.
* The analysts did not want to make the old standards less restrictive for investors, but rather to reflect the true market value.
* The analysts' intention was not to help investors, but to correct the market's overvaluation.
* Loosening the old standards would not necessarily make them less restrictive for investors.<|eot_id|>
