You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The author began with a set of hunches or hypotheses about what can go wrong in agency management, and what would be evidence supporting-or contradicting-these hypotheses. 
Statement: The hunches provided by the author weren't realistic as it pertains to agency management. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context does not provide enough information to determine the realism of the author's hunches.
* The context only mentions the author's hunches, but does not provide any evidence or evaluation of their realism.
* The context focuses on the author's methodology (forming hypotheses and looking for evidence), but does not provide any conclusion or judgment about the hunches themselves.
* The statement makes a claim about the realism of the hunches, but the context does not provide any information to support or contradict this claim.
* The context does not define what "realistic" means in the context of agency management, making it impossible to determine whether the hunches are realistic or not.
* The context does not provide any information about the author's expertise or qualifications in agency management, which could affect the judgment of the realism of their hunches.<|eot_id|>
