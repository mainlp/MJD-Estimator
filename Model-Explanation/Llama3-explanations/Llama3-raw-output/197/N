* The statement does not specify when Reich referred to the chart, so it is unclear if he referred to it before or after Saxton's opening statement.
* The statement does not provide enough information to determine if Reich's misunderstanding of the chart is related to its appearance or content.
* The context only mentions that the chart did not look as Reich claims, but it does not provide information about the content or accuracy of the chart.
* The statement does not specify what exactly Reich misunderstood about the chart, which makes it difficult to determine the truth value of the statement.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if Reich's misunderstanding was intentional or unintentional.
* The statement does not provide enough information to determine if Reich's reference to the chart was based on his own observation or someone else's description.
* The context only provides information about the appearance of the chart, but it does not provide information about Reich's understanding of the chart's meaning or significance.<|eot_id|>
