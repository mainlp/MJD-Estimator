* The context does not mention a "tomb garden", it mentions a "tomb guardian", which is a different entity.
* The context does not imply that the tomb guardian can give a thorough tour, only that it will give a candle to explore the catacombs.
* The context suggests that the catacombs are small and not worth the effort, implying that a thorough tour might not be possible or necessary.
* There is no information about the capabilities or resources of the tomb guardian or the tomb garden (if it exists) to provide a thorough tour.
* The context does not provide enough information to infer that the tomb garden (or the tomb guardian) has the ability or authority to give a thorough tour of the catacombs.<|eot_id|>
