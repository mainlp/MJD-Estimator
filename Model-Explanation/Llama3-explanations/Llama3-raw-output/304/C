You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases.

Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* "Started" implies a sudden movement, but "moved swiftly" implies a continuous or prolonged movement, which contradicts the suddenness of "started".
* "Blanched" implies a change in facial color, but "her face pale" implies a static state of paleness, which contradicts the change implied by "blanched".
* "Blanched" typically implies a loss of color or a whitening of the face, whereas "her face pale" could imply a range of pale shades, which might not necessarily be the same as "blanched".
* The context suggests a sudden reaction or shock, but "moved swiftly" implies a sense of control or deliberation, which contradicts the sudden and potentially uncontrolled nature of the reaction.<|eot_id|>
