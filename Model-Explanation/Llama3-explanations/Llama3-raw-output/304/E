You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Suddenly she started, and her face blanched. 
Statement: She moved swiftly, her face pale. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* "Started" implies sudden movement, which is equivalent to moving swiftly.
* "Blanched" means her face became pale, which is equivalent to having a pale face.
* The context describes a sudden reaction, and the statement is a plausible consequence of that reaction.
* The use of "suddenly" in the context and "swiftly" in the statement suggests a rapid action, which is consistent with the described scenario.
* The change in her facial expression (blanching) is likely accompanied by a physical response (moving swiftly), which is a common human reaction to sudden stimuli.<|eot_id|>
