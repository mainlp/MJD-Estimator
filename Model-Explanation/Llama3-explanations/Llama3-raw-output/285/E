* The opposite of "it wouldn't matter" implies that there is a preference, which is to plant when it is colder.
* The context implies that planting when it's getting warmer is not preferred, so the opposite (planting when it's colder) is better.
* The speaker's tone ("oh really") suggests a contradiction or a correction, implying that planting when it's colder is actually better.
* The phrase "it wouldn't matter" is a hedge, implying that there is a slight advantage to planting when it's colder.
* The context implies that there is a trade-off between planting when it's getting warmer and planting when it's colder, and the speaker believes the latter is better.<|eot_id|>
