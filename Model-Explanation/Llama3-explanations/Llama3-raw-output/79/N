* The statement is too strong, as the context only provides examples of what signatures can show, but does not exclude other possibilities.
* The context does not provide an exhaustive list of what signatures can show, leaving room for other possibilities.
* The word "usually" in the context implies that there may be exceptions or additional uses of signatures beyond attestations, verifications, and approvals.
* The context does not define what is meant by "show", leaving open the possibility that signatures may imply or indicate other things beyond attestations, verifications, and approvals.
* The statement is making a universal claim ("the only things"), which is not supported by the context, which only provides a partial description of the role of signatures.<|eot_id|>
