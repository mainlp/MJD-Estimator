* The statement implies exclusivity, but the context only mentions that attestations, verifications, and approvals are "usually shown" by a signature, leaving room for other possibilities.
* The context does not rule out the possibility that signatures in manual systems can show other things beyond attestations, verifications, and approvals.
* The word "usually" in the context implies that there may be exceptions or additional uses of signatures in manual systems.
* Signatures in manual systems may also serve as proof of identity, authorization, or authentication, which are not mentioned in the context.
* Signatures may be used to indicate receipt, acknowledgement, or understanding, which are not limited to attestations, verifications, or approvals.<|eot_id|>
