Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The context explicitly states that attestations, verifications, and approvals are shown by a signature or initial, implying that these are the only things shown by signatures.
* The use of "usually" in the context suggests that there may be exceptions, but in general, signatures are only used to show attestations, verifications, or approvals.
* The context does not mention any other purpose or function of signatures in manual systems, implying that these are the only purposes they serve.
* The phrase "on a hard copy document" suggests that the signature is being used to authenticate or validate the document, which is consistent with the idea that signatures show attestations, verifications, or approvals.<|eot_id|>
