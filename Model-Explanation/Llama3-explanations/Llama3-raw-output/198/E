* The conversation topics mentioned (the great blizzard of 1978 and the freak snowstorm of May 1977) are specific events, implying that the group discusses specific instances or cases, not just general weather.
* The group is described as "specialized", which suggests a focus on a specific aspect of weather (Northeastern weather), rather than general weather discussion.
* The phrase "talk shop" implies that the group is focused on in-depth, technical, or detailed discussions, which may not be typical of a general discussion group.
* The mention of a specific region (Northeastern) in the group's name suggests a geographic focus, which may not be characteristic of a general discussion group.<|eot_id|>
