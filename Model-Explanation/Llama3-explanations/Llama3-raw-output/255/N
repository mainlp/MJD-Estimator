* The context does not mention bonding exercises at all, so it cannot be inferred that they were mandatory or not.
* The context only talks about professional and administrative staffs, but does not provide information about the activities or exercises they organized for members.
* There is no evidence in the context to suggest that bonding exercises were a requirement for members.
* The context focuses on the staff's role in facilitating participation, but does not imply that participation was mandatory or involved specific activities like bonding exercises.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether bonding exercises were even present, let alone mandatory.
* The statement is making a claim about a specific type of activity (bonding exercises), which is not mentioned in the context, so it cannot be determined to be true or false.<|eot_id|>
