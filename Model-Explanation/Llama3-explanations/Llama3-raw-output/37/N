* The statement contradicts the context, which states it took 400 years for Christian kings to subdue the Moors, implying the Moors were not able to subdue the Christian kings.
* The context does not provide any information about the Moors subduing Christian kings, only the other way around.
* The timeframe mentioned in the statement (a decade) is inconsistent with the timeframe mentioned in the context (400 years).
* The context implies a prolonged and difficult process for Christian kings to subdue the Moors, which is incompatible with the idea of the Moors being subdued quickly.
* There is no mention of the Moors subduing Christian kings in the context, making it impossible to infer the statement from the given information.<|eot_id|>
