Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The woman rolled and drew two spears, implying she was on the ground and grabbing her weapon.
* The horse had rolled, suggesting it was also on the ground, and the woman and horse were in a similar position.
* The phrase "before the horse had rolled" implies a temporal relationship, suggesting the woman and horse were in a similar state (on the ground) at some point.
* The use of "rolled" to describe both the woman's and horse's actions creates a parallelism, implying they were in a similar situation, including being on the ground and grabbing their weapons.
* The context implies a scene of battle or combat, where it is common for participants to be on the ground and grabbing their weapons.<|eot_id|>
