Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The woman had already rolled and drawn two spears, implying she was not on the ground grabbing her weapons.
* The horse had not rolled yet, so it's unlikely they were in rotation on the ground.
* The context implies a sequence of events, with the woman acting before the horse, making it unlikely they were simultaneously grabbing their weapons.
* The phrase "on the ground" contradicts the idea of the woman rolling and drawing spears, which suggests she was in a standing or moving position.
* The context does not mention anyone else besides the woman and the horse, so "they" is ambiguous and cannot be referring to a group of people grabbing their weapons.<|eot_id|>
