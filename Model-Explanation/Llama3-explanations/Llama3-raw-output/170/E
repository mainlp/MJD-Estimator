Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The forms of authority given to an agency imply that some agencies have more freedom to incur obligations than others.
* The concept of budgetary resources implies that there is a limited amount to be distributed among agencies, leading to a natural hierarchy of allocation.
* The authority to incur obligations is not uniform across all agencies, resulting in some having more resources than others.
* The purpose of budgetary resources is to enable agencies to fulfill their specific goals, and some agencies may require more resources to achieve their objectives.
* The allocation of budgetary resources is often based on the agency's importance, size, or scope, which can lead to some agencies receiving more resources than others.
* The forms of authority given to an agency may be influenced by factors such as the agency's performance, efficiency, or strategic importance, resulting in some agencies receiving more resources.<|eot_id|>
