* The statement assumes a motivation (moving against waste) that is not explicitly stated in the context.
* The context only mentions that Clinton could depict himself as a crusader against waste, but does not confirm that this was his actual intention.
* The context provides an alternative explanation for Clinton's action (to depict himself as a crusader), which does not necessarily imply that moving against waste was the primary reason.
* The statement oversimplifies the context, which suggests that Clinton's action was part of a larger strategy to improve his image.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether moving against waste was a primary, secondary, or incidental effect of Clinton's action.
* The statement implies a causal relationship between Clinton's action and moving against waste, which is not explicitly supported by the context.<|eot_id|>
