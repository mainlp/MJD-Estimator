Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context implies Clinton shuttered the DOE to depict himself as a crusader, not to move against waste.
* The context suggests Clinton's motivation was to succeed where Reagan failed, not to move against waste.
* The context does not provide any evidence that Clinton shuttered the DOE because of waste within the DOE itself.
* The context implies Clinton's action was more about political posturing than a genuine attempt to reduce waste.
* The statement oversimplifies Clinton's motivations, which were more complex and politically driven according to the context.<|eot_id|>
