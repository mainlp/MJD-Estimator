Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The tip was hooked towards the edge, implying it was strong and sharp enough to cause damage.
* The comparison to knives used for slaughter suggests the tip was designed for heavy-duty use, contradicting the idea of being fragile.
* The fact that the tips are hammered for knives used for slaughter implies a level of robustness, making it unlikely they would be fragile.
* The shape and design of the tip, being hooked towards the edge, would allow it to leave a scratch, contradicting the statement.<|eot_id|>
