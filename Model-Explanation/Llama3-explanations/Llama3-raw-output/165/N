* The context only establishes Jim Lehrer's credibility, but does not provide information about the gullibility or critical thinking skills of "everyone".
* It is possible that some people might be skeptical or critical of Jim Lehrer's statements, even if he is credible.
* The context does not imply that Jim Lehrer's credibility is universally recognized or that everyone would automatically believe him.
* The statement is an exaggeration, as it is unlikely that "everyone" would believe whatever Jim Lehrer said, without exception.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the extent to which Jim Lehrer's credibility influences people's beliefs.
* The statement is too absolute, and the context does not support such a categorical claim.<|eot_id|>
