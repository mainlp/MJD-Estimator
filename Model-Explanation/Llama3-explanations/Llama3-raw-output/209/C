* The speaker would have plowed everything under and had a rice field if it had rained more, implying that it didn't rain enough to flood everything.
* The speaker is considering planting Saint Augustine grass, which is not suitable for flooded or waterlogged conditions, indicating that the area is not flooded.
* The speaker is planning to plant grass, which suggests that the area is not currently a rice paddy.
* The context implies that the speaker is joking or exaggerating about having a rice field, making the statement about flooding and rice patties unlikely to be true.<|eot_id|>
