Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The party sought to continue close ties with Britain, and Britain has close ties with the United States, so it is likely the party would also seek ties with the US.
* The party supported capitalist policies, and the US is a capitalist country, so it is likely the party would seek ties with the US to further its capitalist goals.
* The party sought to continue close ties with the rest of the Commonwealth, and the US has historical ties with the Commonwealth, so it is likely the party would also seek ties with the US.
* The party's aim to support capitalist policies and continue close ties with Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth implies a broader goal of establishing relationships with other Western, capitalist countries, including the US.<|eot_id|>
