Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is NOT true (contradiction):

* The context describes the exterior as "splendid", implying it is impressive and attractive, which contradicts the statement's claim that the outside is not much to look at.
* The context highlights the exterior's golden onion-shaped cupolas, which suggests a visually striking feature, contradicting the statement's negative assessment of the outside.
* The statement's contrast between the outside and inside implies that the outside is plain, but the context suggests the opposite, that the outside is notable for its beauty.<|eot_id|>
