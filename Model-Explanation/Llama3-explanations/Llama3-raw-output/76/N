Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions the speaker's current part-time job, not their first part-time job.
* The context does not provide information about the speaker's first part-time job, only their current job and eating habits.
* The context mentions the speaker's favorite restaurant, but it is unclear if this is the same restaurant where they had their first part-time job.
* The context does not explicitly state the speaker's first part-time job was in the same restaurant they currently work at.
* The context only mentions the affordability of eating out, but not the speaker's work history.
* The statement assumes a specific restaurant, but the context does not confirm this.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if the speaker's first part-time job was in Salisbury or somewhere else.<|eot_id|>
