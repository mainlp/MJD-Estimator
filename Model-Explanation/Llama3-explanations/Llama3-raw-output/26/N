You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: But I'll take up my stand somewhere near, and when he comes out of the building I'll drop a handkerchief or something, and off you go!" 
Statement: I want you to follow him, so watch for the signal that I give. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions dropping a handkerchief or something, but it doesn't explicitly state that the signal is for the listener to follow him.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine if the speaker wants the listener to follow the person for a specific purpose or with a specific intention.
* The statement is too general and doesn't provide enough context to determine the speaker's intent or the listener's role in following the person.
* The context only mentions the speaker taking a stand and giving a signal, but it doesn't explicitly state what the listener is supposed to do after receiving the signal.
* The statement is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways, such as the listener following the person for surveillance, assistance, or some other purpose.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine the relationship between the speaker, the listener, and the person being followed.
* The statement is too vague and doesn't provide enough context to determine the scope or boundaries of the task being assigned to the listener.<|eot_id|>
