Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The speaker previously uttered the word "no" to someone, which is evident from the context "No, I exclaimed".
* The speaker was astonished, which implies being utterly surprised, as mentioned in the statement.
* The use of "exclaimed" in the context suggests a strong emotional response, which aligns with the idea of being "utterly surprised" in the statement.
* The context implies a conversation or interaction with someone ("him" in the statement), which is supported by the quote "No, I exclaimed".
* The statement's phrase "said no to him several times" can be inferred from the context's "No, I exclaimed", assuming the speaker repeated their refusal or disbelief.<|eot_id|>
