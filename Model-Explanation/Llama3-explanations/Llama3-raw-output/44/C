Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* "it" is not a physical space that can be traversed by walking.
* There are other better ways to get through "it", such as running, swimming, or using a vehicle.
* "it" is an abstract concept or a metaphor, and walking is not applicable.
* "it" is a problem or a challenge, and walking is not a viable solution.
* "it" is a emotional or psychological state, and walking is not an effective way to overcome it.
* "it" is a specific obstacle or barrier that cannot be traversed by walking, such as a wall or a body of water.
* The context implies that walking is not the best way, but rather a necessary or only way to get through "it".<|eot_id|>
