Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions that walking is a way to get through "it", but it doesn't provide any information about whether it's the best way or not.
* The statement assumes a comparison with other ways to get through "it", but the context doesn't provide any alternatives to compare with.
* The context doesn't provide any information about the nature of "it", which could affect the suitability of walking as a means to get through it.
* The statement expresses a subjective opinion ("the best way"), but the context doesn't provide any objective criteria to support or refute this claim.
* The context only mentions that walking is possible, but it doesn't provide any information about the efficiency, safety, or convenience of walking compared to other methods.<|eot_id|>
