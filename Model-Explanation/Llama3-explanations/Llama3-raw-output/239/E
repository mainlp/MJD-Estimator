4. The focus on eggshell worship is diverting attention away from the threat posed by the Satheri.
5. The ceremony is somehow draining the energy or morale of the people, making them weaker against the Satheri.
6. The worship is causing people to prioritize the eggshell over the safety and security of their community, leading to weakness against the Satheri.
