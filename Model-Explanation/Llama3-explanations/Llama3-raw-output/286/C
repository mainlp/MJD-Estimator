* The instructors are not marked with armbands, but rather the students are given armbands.
* You don't just find any instructor, but rather one who is not doing anything.
* You don't just approach an instructor anytime you want to know anything, but rather when you see one who is not busy.
* You don't just ask them questions, but rather tap them on the shoulder first.<|eot_id|>
