Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions that instructors are given an arm band, but it doesn't explicitly state that the armband is a mark or an identifier.
* The statement assumes that the armband is a distinctive feature that sets instructors apart, but the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm this.
* The context mentions that you can tap any instructor on the shoulder to ask questions, but it doesn't imply that you need to find an instructor with an armband specifically.
* The statement implies that instructors are always available to answer questions, but the context only mentions that you can ask questions if you see an instructor who's not doing anything.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine if the armband is a unique identifier for instructors or if it serves some other purpose.
* The statement assumes a level of proactivity from the instructors, implying that they will show you things, but the context only mentions that they will answer questions.<|eot_id|>
