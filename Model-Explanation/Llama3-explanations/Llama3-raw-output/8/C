Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The statement contradicts the context because it says she never regained her memory, but the context states that she recovered her memory.
* The context implies that she has regained her memory, which is the opposite of what the statement claims.
* The phrase "recovering her memory" in the context indicates that she has regained her memory, making the statement false.
* The context suggests that her current state is a result of regaining her memory, which contradicts the statement's claim that she never regained it.
* The statement's negative tone ("it is too bad") implies that not regaining her memory is undesirable, but the context presents regaining her memory as a significant event, implying the opposite.<|eot_id|>
