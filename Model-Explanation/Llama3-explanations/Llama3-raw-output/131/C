* The context only mentions the back of the train lying still on the tracks, implying the entire train is stationary.
* There is no indication of the train starting to move in the context.
* The phrase "lying still" explicitly conveys a state of non-movement.
* The context does not provide any information about the train's future actions or changes in its state.<|eot_id|>
