Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* He is a conservative Democrat, which means he is not likely to win a general election coming out of the right lane of the Democratic Party, so he will not run.
* Running in a general election requires broad appeal, which a conservative Democrat may not have, so he will not run.
* The right lane of the Democratic Party is not a viable path to winning a general election, so he will not run.
* He is not electable as a conservative Democrat, so he will not run in a general election.
* His conservative views will alienate Democratic voters, making it impossible for him to win a general election, so he will not run.<|eot_id|>
