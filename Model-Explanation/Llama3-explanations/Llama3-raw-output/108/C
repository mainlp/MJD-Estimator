* The context only mentions the judge giving vent to a faint murmur, not ordering the court to be silent.
* The judge's reaction is described as a "faint murmur of disapprobation", which is a subtle expression of disapproval, not a loud order to be silent.
* The prisoner's reaction is described as leaning forward angrily, which suggests that the judge's murmur did not have a silencing effect.
* There is no mention of the judge using a loud or authoritative tone, which is typically associated with ordering someone to be silent.
* The context implies a sense of tension and conflict, which is not consistent with the judge successfully ordering the court to be silent.<|eot_id|>
