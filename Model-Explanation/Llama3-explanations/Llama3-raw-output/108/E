Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The judge's murmur of disapprobation implies a reprimand, which is often followed by an order to be silent.
* The prisoner's angry reaction suggests that the judge had to intervene to restore order, which would involve ordering the court to be silent.
* The judge's disapprobation and the prisoner's anger create a tense atmosphere, which the judge would need to calm by ordering silence.
* The judge's murmur of disapprobation is a warning, and the next logical step would be to order the court to be silent to maintain decorum.
* The prisoner's leaning forward angrily may have been accompanied by an outburst, which the judge would need to quell by ordering silence.<|eot_id|>
