* The speaker is emphasizing the extent of their gratitude, which is conveyed by "too" in the context, suggesting that the help received was significant.
* The tone of the context is polite and appreciative, which is consistent with the statement's expression of gratitude.
* The use of "bye-bye" in the context suggests a sense of closure or finality, which may imply that the help received was sufficient or complete, leading the speaker to express their gratitude.
