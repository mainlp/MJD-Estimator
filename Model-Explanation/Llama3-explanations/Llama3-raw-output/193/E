Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

1. The phrase "gone a long way" implies significant progress, which is attributed to the information found in the elementary book, indicating that he learned a lot from it.
2. The context suggests that the elementary book was the primary source of information, and he was able to make substantial progress with it, implying that he learned a lot from the book.
3. The fact that he was able to "go a long way" with the knowledge from a single elementary book indicates that the book provided a substantial amount of useful information, which he was able to learn and apply.
4. The phrase "what he'd found" implies that he discovered or learned something significant from the book, which enabled him to make progress, thus supporting the claim that he learned a lot from it.
5. The context implies a causal relationship between the information in the elementary book and his progress, suggesting that the book was a valuable source of knowledge that he was able to learn from.<|eot_id|>
