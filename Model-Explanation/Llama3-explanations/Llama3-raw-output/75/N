You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Krugman's column will henceforth be known as The Dismal Science, a phrase too famous to be ownable by anyone, except possibly British essayist Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881), who coined it. 
Statement: Krugman writes novels.

* The context only mentions Krugman's column, not his other works, so it does not provide enough information to infer whether he writes novels or not.
* The context focuses on the name of Krugman's column, not his profession or types of writing, making the statement unrelated to the context.
* There is no mention of Krugman's profession or occupation, which could imply that he writes novels, but it is not explicitly stated.
* The context only provides information about the origin of the phrase "The Dismal Science" and its connection to Thomas Carlyle, which is irrelevant to Krugman's writing genre.
* The statement is making a claim about Krugman's writing habits, but the context does not provide any evidence or counter-evidence to support or refute this claim.<|eot_id|>
