* The subject of the study is different (government postal service vs. "it" or "check")
* The context implies that the study is about the government postal service's ability to engage in negotiations, but the statement is about studying something else
* The statement is too vague, and "check" is not a clear or specific topic for study
* The tone of the context is more formal and serious, while the statement is more casual and informal
* The context implies a more in-depth or thorough examination, while the statement implies a simpler or more superficial "check"<|eot_id|>
