Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context mentions "serious study" is needed to determine if a government postal service can engage in certain negotiations, and the statement says "serious study needed to check", implying that the study is needed to check or determine the same thing.
* The phrase "deserves serious study" in the context implies that a thorough examination or investigation is required, and the statement "serious study needed to check" conveys the same idea.
* The context and statement both convey the idea that a careful and thorough examination is necessary, which is the essence of "serious study".
* The statement is a paraphrased version of the context, with "to check" being an implicit reference to the issue of whether a government postal service can engage in certain negotiations.<|eot_id|>
