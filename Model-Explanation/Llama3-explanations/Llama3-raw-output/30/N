* The context only mentions that Cubans "wouldn't like that a bit", which is a milder sentiment than "going up in arms", leaving room for interpretation.
* The context does not explicitly state that Cubans would resort to violence, making the statement's inference uncertain.
* The phrase "wouldn't like that a bit" could imply a range of reactions, from mild discontent to strong opposition, without necessarily implying armed resistance.
* The context focuses on Cuba's dislike of annexation, but the statement shifts the focus to Cubans' potential actions, introducing uncertainty.
* The statement's language is more dramatic and emphatic than the context, making it difficult to determine if it's a direct consequence of the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the likelihood or intensity of Cubans' reaction, making the statement's inference uncertain.<|eot_id|>
