Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* "they wouldn't like that a bit" implies strong opposition, which would manifest as violent resistance or going "up in arms".
* The use of "wouldn't like that a bit" suggests a strong negative emotional response, which would lead to a passionate and potentially violent reaction.
* The idea of annexation implies a loss of autonomy and sovereignty, which would be a highly provocative and inflammatory act, likely to elicit a strong and violent response from Cubans.
* The phrase "go up in arms" is a common idiomatic expression for violent rebellion or resistance, which is a plausible consequence of an annexation attempt given the context.
* The tone of the context implies a sense of warning or caution, suggesting that attempting to annex Cuba would have severe and potentially violent consequences, including Cubans going "up in arms".<|eot_id|>
