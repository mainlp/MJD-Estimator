* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, so it should be true, not false.
* There is no information in the context that suggests Carrey's Kaufman was diagnosed with cancer after deciding to do a show at Carnegie Hall.
* The context does not mention multiple diagnoses or multiple shows, so the order of events cannot be reversed.
* The context does not provide any alternative explanations for Carrey's Kaufman's decision to do a show at Carnegie Hall that would contradict the statement.<|eot_id|>
