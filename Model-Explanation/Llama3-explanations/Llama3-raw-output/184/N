* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but NLI models may not always detect paraphrases correctly.
* The context does not explicitly state that the diagnosis happened before the decision, it only lists the events in a sequence.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the temporal relationship between the diagnosis and the decision.
* The statement is a trivial inference, and some NLI models may not consider it a meaningful inference.
* The context and the statement are very similar, and some NLI models may not be able to distinguish between them.
* The statement does not add any new information beyond what is already present in the context.
* The context does not provide any alternative explanations or counterexamples that would contradict the statement.
* The statement is a straightforward logical consequence of the context, but some NLI models may not always draw logical conclusions correctly.<|eot_id|>
