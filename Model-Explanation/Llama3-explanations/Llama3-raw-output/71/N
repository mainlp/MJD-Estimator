* The context only mentions one specific campaign in Russia, which is described as "disastrous", implying it was not successful, but it does not provide information about other invasions.
* The statement makes a general claim about Russia being invaded "hundreds of times", which is not supported or contradicted by the context.
* The context focuses on a specific event (drawing up a statute for the Com√©die-Francaise) and does not provide information about the outcome of the campaign or the history of invasions in Russia.
* The statement's claim is too broad and general to be determined by the specific information provided in the context.
* There is no explicit contradiction between the context and the statement, but also no clear support for the statement's claim.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the accuracy of the statement's claim about the frequency or success of invasions in Russia.<|eot_id|>
