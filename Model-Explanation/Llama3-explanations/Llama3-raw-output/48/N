You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases.

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions that the idea persisted, but it doesn't provide a reason for its persistence, so the added phrase "out of protest" is not supported or contradicted by the context.
* The context doesn't provide any information about the motivation behind the persistence, so it's unclear whether it was out of protest or not.
* The statement adds new information ("out of protest") that is not present in the context, making it impossible to determine its truth value based on the context alone.
* The context only mentions the speaker's action (rejecting the idea) and its consequence (the idea persisting), but it doesn't provide any insight into the underlying reasons or motivations, making the added phrase uncertain.
* The phrase "out of protest" implies a specific motivation or intention, which is not addressed in the context, leaving the statement's truth value undetermined.<|eot_id|>
