* The context does not mention "out of protest" as the reason for persistence.
* The context implies that the persistence is despite the rejection, not as a response to it.
* The word "nevertheless" in the context suggests a contrast between the rejection and the persistence, which is not compatible with the idea of persistence "out of protest".
* The context does not provide any evidence or implication that the persistence is a deliberate act, which is implied by "out of protest".
* The phrase "out of protest" adds a new information that is not present in the original context.<|eot_id|>
