You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: There's a lot of villas all the way along, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and in the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. 
Statement: There were only a few villas the whole way along, until we reached a small village that seemed to be the end. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context states "a lot of villas" whereas the statement says "only a few villas".
* The context implies a gradual decrease in the number of villas, whereas the statement suggests a small number of villas throughout.
* The context mentions a single villa that seemed to be the last, whereas the statement mentions a small village.
* The context does not mention a village, whereas the statement does.
* The context implies a continuous stretch of villas, whereas the statement suggests a distinct endpoint (a small village).<|eot_id|>
