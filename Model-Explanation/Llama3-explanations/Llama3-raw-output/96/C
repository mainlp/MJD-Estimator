You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Ca'daan heard the Kal grunt and felt the horse lift. 
Statement: The Kal heard Ca'daan grunt. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The subject performing the action "heard" is Ca'daan, not the Kal.
* The one grunting is the Kal, not Ca'daan.
* The sentence structure and word order imply a different sequence of events.
* The context suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the Kal's grunt causes Ca'daan to feel the horse lift, which is not possible if Ca'daan grunted.
* The use of "heard" and "grunt" in the statement is inconsistent with the context, which uses "heard" and "felt" to describe Ca'daan's actions.<|eot_id|>
