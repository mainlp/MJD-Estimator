Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The speaker could see downtown Dallas from their home in Wylie, implying proximity.
* The speaker commuted to work from Wylie, suggesting a reasonable driving distance.
* The speaker's ability to remember the commute implies it was a regular, manageable trip.
* The speaker's mention of "coming to work" implies a daily or frequent commute, which would be unlikely if the distance were too great.<|eot_id|>
