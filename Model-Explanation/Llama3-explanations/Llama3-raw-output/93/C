Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The speaker could see downtown Dallas from Wylie, implying it was visible from a distance, which contradicts the idea that it was a short drive.
* The speaker had to commute to work from Wylie, suggesting the distance was significant enough to require a notable amount of time or effort, contradicting the idea of a short drive.
* The speaker's ability to remember the commute implies it was a notable or significant experience, which may not be consistent with a short drive.<|eot_id|>
