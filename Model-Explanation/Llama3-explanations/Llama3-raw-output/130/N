Statement: Tommy handed Tuppence an empty shabby green notebook. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context does not explicitly state whether the notebook is empty or not.
* The focus of the context is on the action of handing over the notebook and Tuppence writing, rather than the state of the notebook.
* The adjective "shabby" describes the appearance of the notebook, but does not provide information about its contents.
* The context does not provide any information about the notebook's contents before it was handed over to Tuppence.
* The fact that Tuppence began writing busily does not necessarily imply that the notebook was empty, as she could be adding to existing content.
* There is no explicit contradiction or confirmation of the statement in the context.<|eot_id|>
