* The notebook is described as "shabby green", but not explicitly stated to be empty.
* The context implies that Tuppence began writing busily, suggesting that the notebook had blank pages or space to write, but not necessarily empty.
* If the notebook were empty, there would be no point in Tuppence writing busily, as there would be no content to write about or add to.
* The phrase "began writing busily" implies that Tuppence had something to write, which contradicts the idea of an empty notebook.<|eot_id|>
