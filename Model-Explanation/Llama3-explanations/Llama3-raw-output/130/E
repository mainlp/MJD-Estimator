Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The notebook is described as "shabby green", which implies it is not new or in good condition, and therefore likely to be empty.
* Tommy "handed over" the notebook, suggesting that he gave it to Tuppence without any prior use or content.
* Tuppence "began writing busily", implying that the notebook was empty and ready for her to start writing in it.<|eot_id|>
