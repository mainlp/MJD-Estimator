You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it 
Statement: An email won't cut it. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions a hard copy, but doesn't explicitly state that an email is an alternative or inferior option.
* The context doesn't provide enough information about the purpose or requirement of the hard copy, making it unclear why an email wouldn't be sufficient.
* The statement "An email won't cut it" implies a certain expectation or requirement, but the context doesn't provide enough information about what that expectation or requirement is.
* The context only mentions that a hard copy is available, but doesn't provide a direct comparison or contrast with an email, making the statement's implication unclear.
* The tone and intent behind the statement "An email won't cut it" is ambiguous, and could be interpreted as either emphasizing the importance of a hard copy or simply stating a fact.<|eot_id|>
