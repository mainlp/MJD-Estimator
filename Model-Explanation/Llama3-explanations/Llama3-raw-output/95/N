You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Exhibit 3 presents total national emissions of NOx and SO2 from all sectors, including power. 
Statement: In Exhibit 3 there are the total regional emissions od NOx and SO2 from all sectors. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions "national" emissions, whereas the statement refers to "regional" emissions, which are not necessarily the same.
* The context does not provide information about regional emissions, so it cannot be determined if the statement is true or false.
* The statement is not a direct contradiction of the context, but it is not directly supported by the context either.
* The context only mentions emissions from "all sectors, including power", but does not specify if it includes regional emissions.
* The term "regional" is not defined in the context, so it is unclear what it refers to.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if the exhibit includes regional emissions or not.<|eot_id|>
