* The context does not provide enough information to infer the statement's truth or falsity.
* The statement is a subjective expectation and the context does not provide a clear objective perspective.
* The context mentions the idea of the devil running a corporate-law firm, but it does not explicitly state what people expect the devil's form to be.
* The context's tone is more focused on the predictability of the plot device rather than the expectation of the devil's form.
* The statement is a universal claim ("nobody expects") which is difficult to prove or disprove without more information.
* The context does not provide a clear definition of "nobody" and who exactly is expected to hold this expectation.
* The statement is a hypothetical scenario and the context does not provide enough information to determine what people's expectations would be in such a scenario.<|eot_id|>
