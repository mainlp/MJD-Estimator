Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context does not mention economists, so it cannot be attributed to them.
* The context states that the cane plantations "found a ready market" which implies that the market was already ready, whereas the statement says "was ready" which implies a future or potential readiness.
* The context does not provide any information about the economists' opinions or statements, so it cannot be said that they made any claims about the US market being ready.<|eot_id|>
