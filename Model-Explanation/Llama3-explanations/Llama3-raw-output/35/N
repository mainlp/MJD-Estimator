Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions that the cane plantations found a ready market in the US, but it does not provide information about economists' opinions on the matter.
* The statement attributes the claim to economists, but the context does not mention economists or their views.
* The context describes a historical event or situation, while the statement appears to be a quote or a claim made by economists, which may or may not be related to the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the economists' claim is true or false, or even if it is relevant to the situation described.
* The statement's wording is slightly different from the context, using "The US market was ready" instead of "found a ready market", which may imply a different perspective or emphasis.<|eot_id|>
