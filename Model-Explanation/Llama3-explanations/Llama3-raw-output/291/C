Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context mentions keeping to the shade in the street, implying that shade is available.
* The statement claims there is no shade, contradicting the assumption of available shade.
* If buildings were low, they would not block sunlight, but the context suggests they do, creating shade.
* The context's advice to stay in the shade implies that shade is a desirable and existing condition, which the statement denies.<|eot_id|>
