* The context mentions "the major change that we have noticed in gardening", implying that some gardening has been done.
* The speaker says "that's about the extent of what we've done", suggesting that some gardening has been done, even if it's limited.
* The mention of "a little bit on the patio" implies that some gardening activity has taken place.
* The speaker mentions waiting for the rain to subside, which implies that the rain has been an obstacle, but it doesn't mean no gardening has been done at all.
* The fact that they finally got to mow the lawn after a month suggests that the rain has been an issue, but it doesn't contradict the idea that some gardening has been done.<|eot_id|>
