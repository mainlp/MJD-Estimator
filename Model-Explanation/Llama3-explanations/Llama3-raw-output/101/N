* The context mentions "that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening" but doesn't specify what that change is, leaving room for interpretation.
* The context states "that's about the extent of what we've done" but doesn't explicitly say what "that" refers to, making it unclear if it's related to gardening or patio work.
* The context mentions "just a little bit on the patio" which might imply some gardening activity, contradicting the statement.
* The context says "waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow" which implies that the rain has prevented mowing, but not necessarily gardening.
* The context mentions "we finally got to mow this weekend" which implies that the rain has subsided, but doesn't provide information about gardening activities.
* The statement "We have not done much gardening yet because of the rain" is not explicitly supported or contradicted by the context, leaving it undetermined.<|eot_id|>
