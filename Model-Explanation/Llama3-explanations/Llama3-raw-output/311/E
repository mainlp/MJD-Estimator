Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The Times is a newspaper that is typically delivered to one's mailbox, so I would look for the advertisement in my mailbox.
* Watching for an advertisement in the Times implies that I expected it to be delivered to me, and the most likely place to receive it is my mailbox.
* The Times is a physical publication, and I would need to receive a physical copy to watch for the advertisement, which would be delivered to my mailbox.
* I was expecting the advertisement to be sent to me directly, and my mailbox is the usual place to receive such mailings.<|eot_id|>
