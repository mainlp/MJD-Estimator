Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only implies that wealthy parents make it possible to go to school, but it does not explicitly state that they are necessary.
* The phrase "unless your parents are wealthy" suggests that there might be other ways to afford school, even if they are not specified.
* The context focuses on the difficulty of affording school, but it does not provide a definitive statement about the necessity of wealthy parents.
* The statement "Wealthy parents are necessary for school" is an overgeneralization of the context, which only mentions that wealthy parents make it easier to afford school.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether wealthy parents are necessary for school or just one of the possible ways to afford it.<|eot_id|>
