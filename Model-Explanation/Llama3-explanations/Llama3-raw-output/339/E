There are no possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context. The context does not mention the sultan drinking from the marble fountains. In fact, it describes the fountains as "handsome" and part of the decoration, but does not imply any functional use by the sultan. The context only mentions the sultan enjoying the music and dancing of his concubines from the canopied throne.<|eot_id|>
