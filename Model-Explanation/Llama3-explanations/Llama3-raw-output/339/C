* The context only mentions the marble fountains as a decorative element, not as a source of drinking water.
* The context implies that the sultan's focus was on enjoying the music and dancing of his concubines, not on drinking from the fountains.
* There is no mention of the marble fountains being functional or containing drinkable water.
* The context suggests a formal and luxurious setting, which would not typically involve drinking directly from fountains.
* The canopied throne is mentioned as the sultan's vantage point, implying that he would be seated and observing, rather than approaching the fountains to drink.<|eot_id|>
