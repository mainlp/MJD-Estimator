* The context only mentions "I followed" without specifying what or whom was followed.
* The direction "down the street" is not mentioned in the context.
* The context does not imply that "he" was walked down the street, only that he walked out into the street.
* The statement assumes a specific direction ("down") that is not present in the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to infer that "he" was the one being followed.<|eot_id|>
