Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context mentions "In his effort to build nationalism across Turkey in the 1920s", which implies that Ataterk was trying to build nationalism in Turkey during the 1920s, and it is likely that this effort continued until 1942.
* The context does not specify that Ataterk's effort to build nationalism stopped after the 1920s, so it can be inferred that he was still trying to build nationalism in 1942.
* The campaign to suppress Kurdish identity, which was instituted by Ataterk, is mentioned as continuing today, implying that Ataterk's efforts to build nationalism were not limited to the 1920s and may have continued until 1942.<|eot_id|>
