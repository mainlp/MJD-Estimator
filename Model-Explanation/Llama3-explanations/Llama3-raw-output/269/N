* The context only mentions Ataterk's efforts in the 1920s, but the statement refers to 1942, which is outside the mentioned time frame.
* The context describes Ataterk's efforts as focused on suppressing Kurdish identity, but the statement only mentions building nationalism, without specifying the means or target.
* Ataterk's death occurred in 1938, so it is unclear if he was still active in 1942.
* The statement does not provide enough information to determine if Ataterk's efforts in 1942 were part of the same campaign mentioned in the context or a separate initiative.
* The context does not provide a comprehensive timeline of Ataterk's activities, so it is unclear if he was still trying to build nationalism in 1942.<|eot_id|>
