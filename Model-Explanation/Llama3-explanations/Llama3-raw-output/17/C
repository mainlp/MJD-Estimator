* The speaker previously mentioned "small kids", implying their involvement is relevant.
* The speaker's question "do you have small kids" suggests that the presence of children is a significant factor.
* The statement "It matters not if children are involved" contradicts the implication that children's involvement is important.
* The context implies that the speaker believes children's involvement does matter, contrary to the statement.
* The speaker's hesitation ("yeah but uh") indicates a contrast between their initial thought and the importance of children being involved.<|eot_id|>
