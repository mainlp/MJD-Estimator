Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context mentions "small kids" but the statement uses the more general term "children", leaving ambiguity about whether they refer to the same age group.
* The context is a question, whereas the statement is a declarative sentence, making it unclear how they relate to each other.
* The statement's phrase "it matters not" is a negation, but it's unclear what specific aspect of the context it's negating or what the implications are.
* The context implies a concern or question about the involvement of small kids, but the statement doesn't clearly address or resolve that concern.
* The statement's tone is somewhat formal and abstract, which may not match the informal and conversational tone of the context, making it hard to determine their relationship.
* The statement doesn't provide enough information to determine its relevance or implications in the context of the conversation about small kids.<|eot_id|>
