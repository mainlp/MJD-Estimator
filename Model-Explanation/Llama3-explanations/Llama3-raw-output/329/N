Statement: They may be valuable. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions "valuable uses" but not that "they" are valuable themselves.
* The context implies possibility of valuable uses, but the statement asserts possibility of "they" being valuable, which is a different claim.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if "they" are valuable or not, only that they could have valuable uses.
* The statement is a weaker claim than the context, as "may be" implies uncertainty, whereas the context is more affirmative.
* The context and statement are talking about different aspects: the context is about the uses, while the statement is about "they" themselves.
* The context does not provide a direct implication or evidence to support or refute the statement.<|eot_id|>
