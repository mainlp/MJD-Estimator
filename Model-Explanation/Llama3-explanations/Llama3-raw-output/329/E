Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

1. The "valuable uses" mentioned in the context imply that "they" possess some value, which makes it possible for them to be valuable.
2. The context suggests that "they" have potential, which could lead to them being valuable.
3. The phrase "could have valuable uses" indicates a possibility, and the statement "they may be valuable" is a direct consequence of that possibility.
4. The context implies that "they" have some inherent value, which is why they could have valuable uses, and therefore, they may be valuable.
5. The statement is a more general and cautious rephrasing of the context, which explicitly states that "they" could have valuable uses, implying that they may be valuable.<|eot_id|>
