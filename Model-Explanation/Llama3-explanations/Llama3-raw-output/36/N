You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: As legal scholar Randall Kennedy wrote in his book Race, Crime, and the Law, Even if race is only one of several factors behind a decision, tolerating it at all means tolerating it as potentially the decisive factor. 
Statement: Race is one of several factors in some judicial decisions 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context does not provide enough information to determine the extent to which race influences judicial decisions.
* The statement only claims that race is one of several factors, but does not specify its relative importance or impact.
* The context highlights the potential for race to be a decisive factor, but the statement does not confirm or deny this possibility.
* The statement is too vague, and it is unclear what "some judicial decisions" refers to, making it difficult to determine the truth of the statement.
* The context presents an opinion or argument (Randall Kennedy's writing), but the statement is a factual claim that may or may not be supported by evidence.
* The statement does not provide enough context to determine whether the presence of race as a factor is acceptable or not, which is the main concern of the original text.<|eot_id|>
