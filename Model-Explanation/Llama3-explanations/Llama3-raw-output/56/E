You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The questions may need to be tailored to 
Statement: There are some questions that may or may not need to be tailored to. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context mentions "the questions" which implies a set of questions, and the statement claims that "there are some questions" which is a subset of the original set.
* The context states that "the questions may need to be tailored to" which implies that some questions might require tailoring, and the statement says "some questions may or may not need to be tailored to" which is a more general and inclusive statement.
* The context does not rule out the possibility that some questions do not need to be tailored to, and the statement explicitly mentions this possibility.
* The statement is a more general and vague statement compared to the context, and the context can be seen as a specific instance of the statement.<|eot_id|>
