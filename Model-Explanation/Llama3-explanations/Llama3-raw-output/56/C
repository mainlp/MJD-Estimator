You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The questions may need to be tailored to 
Statement: There are some questions that may or may not need to be tailored to. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context implies that all questions may need to be tailored, leaving no room for questions that may not need to be tailored.
* The context suggests that the need for tailoring is not optional, whereas the statement implies that it is optional.
* The statement's "may or may not" phrase is inconsistent with the context's implication that tailoring is a necessity.
* The context implies a universal requirement for tailoring, whereas the statement suggests that only some questions may need tailoring, leaving others unaffected.
* The statement's ambiguity about which questions need tailoring contradicts the context's implication that all questions are affected.<|eot_id|>
