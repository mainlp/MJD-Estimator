Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The discount is not related to safety features or maintenance, but rather to other factors such as fuel efficiency or empty seats.
* The airline has implemented additional safety measures to compensate for the discount.
* The discount is offered by a reputable airline with a good safety record.
* The discount is for a specific route or time of year that is inherently safer.
* The discount is not a reflection of the airline's safety standards, but rather a marketing strategy.
* The airline has received safety certifications or awards that ensure its safety despite the discount.
* The discount is for a newer, safer aircraft or a more experienced pilot.
* The discount is a one-time offer and not a regular practice, so safety is not compromised.<|eot_id|>
