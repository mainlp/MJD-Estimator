Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context implies that discounted flying is more dangerous, but the statement claims it's totally safe.
* The statement contradicts the expectation of increased danger associated with discounted flying.
* The context suggests a trade-off between cost and safety, but the statement denies this trade-off.
* The statement's assertion of total safety is inconsistent with the context's implication of increased risk.
* The context implies a higher risk of accidents or incidents with discounted flying, which the statement negates.<|eot_id|>
