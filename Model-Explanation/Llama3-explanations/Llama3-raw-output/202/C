* The speaker is making sense, as they are expressing their lack of knowledge about an event.
* The speaker's statement is coherent and grammatically correct, indicating they are making sense.
* The speaker's admission of uncertainty ("I don't know") is a rational and sensible response to a situation where they lack information.
* The speaker's use of the phrase "exactly" suggests they are attempting to clarify their thoughts, which implies they are making sense.
