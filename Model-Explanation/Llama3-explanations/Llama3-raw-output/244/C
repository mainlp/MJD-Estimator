Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context mentions "LSC Office of Program Performance and its state planning team", not "lawyers".
* The experience is in "LSC-funded programs", not with lawyers.
* There is no mention of lawyers in the context.
* The context implies a collective experience of the team, not a single entity like "the LSC".
* The context does not mention the LSC as a whole having experience, but rather the Office of Program Performance and the state planning team.<|eot_id|>
