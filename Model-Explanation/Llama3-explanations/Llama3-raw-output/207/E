You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. 
Statement: Identity should be a minimum requirement. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The context mentions "some proof of identity" as a possible requirement, implying that identity verification is necessary.
* The mention of "password" and "proof of identity" suggests that security or authentication is a concern, and identity is a fundamental aspect of that.
* The phrase "at any rate" indicates that even if a password is not required, proof of identity is still necessary, making identity a minimum requirement.
* The context implies that access or permission is being granted, and verifying identity is a basic step in that process.
* The idea of "some proof of identity" implies that identity is not just a nice-to-have, but a necessary condition to be met.<|eot_id|>
