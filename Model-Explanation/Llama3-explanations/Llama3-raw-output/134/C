* The context mentions multiple groups (Gallo-Romans, Visigoths, Franks, and medieval French) contributing to the fortress, implying it was not built by a single group.
* The context mentions "layers of their masonry in the ramparts", suggesting a gradual construction process over time, rather than a single event in 1173.
* The context does not mention a specific date, 1173, for the construction of the fortress.
* The medieval French are mentioned as one of the groups that used the fortress, but not as its sole builders.
* The statement implies a single point of construction, whereas the context suggests a process of modification and addition over time.<|eot_id|>
