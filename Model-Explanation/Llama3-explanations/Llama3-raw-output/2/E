Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The process involves multiple steps and stakeholders, implying a lengthy procedure.
* The committee consists of many members from different branches of government, which may lead to delays and inefficiencies.
* The process requires the President's appointment, adding an extra layer of complexity and potential delay.
* The involvement of multiple committees and leaders may lead to disagreements and negotiations, prolonging the process.
* The statute's provision for a committee to recommend an individual suggests a formal and potentially time-consuming process.
* The need for reform in the coming years implies that the current process is perceived as inefficient or ineffective, supporting the claim that it is long.<|eot_id|>
