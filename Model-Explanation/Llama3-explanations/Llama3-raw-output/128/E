Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The chains' influence persuades big publishers to prioritize blockbusters over moderate-selling books, implying a focus on high-budget productions.
* The production of more blockbusters at the expense of moderate-selling books suggests a preference for high-budget, high-reward projects, which could extend to films.
* The alleged manipulation of big publishers by the chains implies a willingness to sacrifice moderate-selling books for more lucrative opportunities, such as high-budget films.
* The context implies a focus on profit over diversity or quality, which could lead big publishers to prioritize high-budget films over books with lower sales potential.
* The idea that chains influence publishers to produce more blockbusters suggests a commercial, profit-driven approach, which would naturally extend to high-budget films.<|eot_id|>
