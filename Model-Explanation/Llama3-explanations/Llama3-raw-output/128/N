* The context only mentions blockbusters, which could refer to books, not films.
* There is no explicit connection between big publishers and high budget films.
* The context implies a potential negative impact on moderate-selling books, but it's unclear if that means big publishers want to produce high budget films.
* The statement assumes a direct causal relationship between producing high budget films and badly selling books, which is not established in the context.
* The context focuses on the influence of chains on publishers, whereas the statement focuses on the desires of big publishers.
* The term "high budget films" is not mentioned in the context, making it difficult to infer the statement from the given information.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether big publishers want to produce high budget films or not.<|eot_id|>
