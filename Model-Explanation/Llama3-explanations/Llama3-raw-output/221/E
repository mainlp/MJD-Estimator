Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The phrase "succeeded where even Reagan failed" implies that Reagan had attempted to shutter the DOE but was unsuccessful.
* The context suggests that Clinton's action was a success, and the comparison to Reagan's failure implies that Reagan had also tried to achieve the same goal.
* The use of "even" in "even Reagan failed" emphasizes that Reagan's failure was notable, implying that he had made a serious attempt to shutter the DOE.
* The contrast between Clinton's success and Reagan's failure implies that Reagan's attempt was genuine, but ultimately unsuccessful.<|eot_id|>
