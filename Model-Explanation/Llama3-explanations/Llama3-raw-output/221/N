Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context does not explicitly state that Reagan tried to shutter the DOE, but it can be inferred.
* The context implies that Clinton succeeded where Reagan failed, but it does not provide direct evidence that Reagan's failure was due to trying to shutter the DOE.
* The context focuses on Clinton's actions and their potential depiction, rather than providing factual information about Reagan's actions.
* The statement assumes a specific reason for Reagan's failure (trying to shutter the DOE), but the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this assumption.
* The context does not provide a clear timeline of events, making it unclear whether Reagan's attempts (if any) to shutter the DOE occurred before or after Clinton's actions.<|eot_id|>
