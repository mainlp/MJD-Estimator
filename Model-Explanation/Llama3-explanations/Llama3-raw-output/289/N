* The context only mentions that the games are "fun to watch", but the statement claims they are "a lot of fun" which is a stronger sentiment, making it uncertain if the speaker agrees with the stronger sentiment.
* The context does not provide enough information about the speaker's personal experience or opinion about playing the games, only that they are fun to watch.
* The context is informal and conversational, with repeated use of "you" and "yeah", which may indicate a casual tone, but does not provide clear evidence for the speaker's stance on the statement.
* The statement is a general assertion, but the context only provides a personal anecdote about watching the games, without explicitly stating the speaker's opinion about the games being fun.
* The context does not rule out the possibility that the speaker finds the games fun to watch, but not necessarily "a lot of fun" to play or participate in.<|eot_id|>
