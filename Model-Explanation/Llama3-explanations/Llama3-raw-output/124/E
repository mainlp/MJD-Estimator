* The team is highly motivated to make history by achieving an undefeated season, and this motivation will persist unless they lose.
* The team's desire to make history implies that they will remain motivated as long as they are close to achieving it, which is the case unless they suffer losses.
* The team's motivation is driven by their proximity to an undefeated season, and unless they lose, this proximity will continue to motivate them.
* The team's motivation is conditional on their performance, and as long as they don't suffer losses, they will remain motivated to achieve their goal.
* The team's desire to "taste" an undefeated season implies a strong motivation that will persist unless they experience setbacks, such as losses.
* The team's motivation is fueled by their ambition to make history, and unless they suffer losses, this ambition will continue to drive them.<|eot_id|>
