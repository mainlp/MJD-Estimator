* The statement implies that motivation is dependent on not suffering losses, but the context suggests that the team is already motivated to make history and have an undefeated season.
* The context states that the team wants to make history, implying that they are motivated regardless of whether they suffer losses or not.
* The team's motivation is driven by their desire to make history, not by their win-loss record.
* The statement suggests a conditional relationship between motivation and losses, but the context presents motivation as an inherent desire to achieve a historic feat.<|eot_id|>
