Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The Academy of Fine Arts is located on the southeast corner of the Maidan, which is not in the northern part of the Maidan.
* The location "southeast corner" is mutually exclusive with "Northern Maidan".
* The context explicitly mentions the location of the Academy of Fine Arts as the southeast corner, which contradicts the statement's claim of it being in the Northern Maidan.<|eot_id|>
