Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context does not mention a love affair at all, making it impossible to infer its existence.
* The quarrel between the stepmother and the person could have been about anything, not necessarily a love affair.
* The context only mentions a quarrel, but does not provide any information about its cause or topic.
* There is no evidence in the context to suggest a romantic relationship or any kind of affair.
* The timing of the quarrel (afternoon before her death) does not imply a love affair sparked at that moment.
* The context focuses on the conflict between the stepmother and the person, rather than a romantic relationship.
* The statement is making an assumption about the content of the quarrel, which is not supported by the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether a love affair existed or not.<|eot_id|>
