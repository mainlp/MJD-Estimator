* The context mentions a quarrel, not a love affair.
* The quarrel was between the stepmother and the person, indicating conflict, not romance.
* The quarrel was a result of the stepmother taxing him with something, implying accusation or confrontation, not affection.
* The context does not mention any romantic or affectionate interaction between the two individuals.
* The timing of the event, "on the afternoon before her death", suggests a tense or dramatic situation, not a romantic encounter.
* The tone of the context is serious and somber, not suggestive of a romantic or passionate atmosphere.<|eot_id|>
