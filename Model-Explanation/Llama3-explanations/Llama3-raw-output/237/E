* There is no mention of a love affair in the context, so the statement is not entailed.
* The context only mentions a quarrel between the stepmother and the person, which does not imply a love affair.
* The quarrel was about the issue that the stepmother had heard, but the nature of the issue is not specified, and it does not suggest a romantic relationship.
* The context only provides information about a conflict, not a romantic encounter.
* The timing of the quarrel (afternoon before her death) does not imply a love affair.
* The context does not provide any information about the person's romantic relationships or feelings.<|eot_id|>
