Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The context only mentions that both authors equate the process of becoming an artist with that of becoming a man, but it does not specify that they did it in the same way.
* The use of "as" in the context suggests a similarity, but not an exact equivalence, in their approaches.
* The context does not provide enough information to conclude that Ellison and Hemingway took the same way to compare becoming a man.
* The statement is true by default, as there is no evidence to suggest that they took the same way to compare becoming a man.
* The context highlights a common theme or idea between the two authors, but does not imply that they expressed it in the same manner.
* The statement is a reasonable inference, as it is unlikely that two different authors would take exactly the same approach to comparing becoming a man.<|eot_id|>
