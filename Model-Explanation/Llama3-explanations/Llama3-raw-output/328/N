* The context only mentions "that" without specifying what "that" refers to, making it unclear if "that" is the same as "our past work".
* The context uses the adverb "spectacularly" to describe the manner in which "that" was done, but it's unclear if this implies the results were also spectacular.
* The statement uses the phrase "the only way to describe" which implies a strong claim, but the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny this claim.
* The context and statement use different words to describe the outcome ("spectacularly" vs "spectacular results"), making it difficult to determine if they are referring to the same thing.
* The context doesn't provide enough information about the nature of "our past work" to determine if the statement's description of the impact is accurate.
* The statement's use of "was" implies a past tense, but the context's use of "have done" implies a present perfect tense, making it unclear if they are referring to the same time period.<|eot_id|>
