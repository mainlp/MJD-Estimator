Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions "that" without specifying what "that" refers to, whereas the statement assumes it refers to "our past work".
* The context uses "spectacularly" to describe the manner in which "that" was done, whereas the statement uses "spectacular" to describe the results.
* The context implies a sense of accomplishment or success, but does not necessarily imply that the results were the only way to describe the impact.
* The statement is too absolute with "the only way", whereas the context is more casual and conversational.
* The context does not mention "results" or "impact", whereas the statement assumes they are relevant and significant.<|eot_id|>
