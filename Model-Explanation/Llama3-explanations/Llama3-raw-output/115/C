* The increase is $6 billion, but the actual increase is $6 billion ($273 billion - $267 billion).
* The statement implies a percentage increase of 2.2% ($6 billion / $267 billion), but the context does not provide a percentage.
* The statement only mentions the increase amount, but not the time frame (by 2002).
* The statement does not explicitly state that the increase is from the current budget to the future budget.<|eot_id|>
