* The context provides a comparison between the current budget and the future budget, but the statement does not explicitly mention the comparison.
* The percentage increase is not provided in the statement, which could be a relevant factor in determining the inference.
* The statement does not account for potential fluctuations in the budget between the current year and 2002.
* The context provides a specific year (2002) for the future budget, but the statement does not mention a specific time frame for the increase.
* The statement could be interpreted as a general statement about the budget increasing, without being specific about the context provided.
