* The statement is a paraphrased version of the context, but it does not provide any additional information to confirm or deny the success of an organization.
* The context only mentions that alignment is necessary, but it does not imply that alignment is sufficient for an organization to be successful.
* The statement does not provide any information about the quality or effectiveness of the alignment, which could impact the organization's success.
* The context does not define what constitutes "success" for an organization, so it is unclear whether alignment is a sufficient condition for achieving it.
* The statement does not account for other factors that could influence an organization's success, such as external circumstances, market conditions, or competitor activity.
* The context only discusses the importance of alignment, but it does not provide any evidence or examples to support the claim that alignment leads to success.<|eot_id|>
