You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: According to a 1995 Financial Executives Research Foundation report,5 transaction processing and other routine accounting activities, such as accounts payable, payroll, and external reporting, consume about 69 percent of costs within finance. 
Statement: The financial world would be ok it there wasn't any 5 percent processing. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* 69% of costs are consumed by transaction processing and other routine accounting activities, which means 31% of costs are not, so eliminating 5% of processing would still leave 26% of non-processing costs.
* The remaining 94% of processing (100% - 5% = 94%) would still be sufficient to cover the 69% of costs consumed by transaction processing and other routine accounting activities.
* The financial world would still have 95% of its current processing capacity, which would likely be enough to maintain its current state.
* The elimination of 5% of processing would not significantly impact the overall financial system, as it would still be able to perform its essential functions.<|eot_id|>
