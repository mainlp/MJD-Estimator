* The context describes the Massabielle quarter as "picturesque", implying a more laid-back or charming atmosphere, which is inconsistent with a "very touristy" place.
* The use of "almost midtown" suggests a more local or residential area, rather than a tourist hotspot.
* The term "faubourg" (French for "suburb" or "outskirts") implies a more peripheral or less central location, which may not be as touristy as a central area.
* The context's focus on the quarter's aesthetic appeal ("most picturesque") rather than its tourist attractions or amenities suggests it may not be a touristy area.<|eot_id|>
