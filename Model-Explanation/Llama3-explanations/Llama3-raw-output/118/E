Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* White's designs on living imply that White values his life, and being far from Little is necessary for survival, so coming back to Little would put White's life at risk.
* The context implies that Little is a dangerous place for White, and if White wants to live, he should avoid it, which means he should be afraid to come back.
* The phrase "as far from Little as he can possibly get" suggests that Little is a threat to White's well-being, and returning to Little would be a risky decision, inducing fear.
* The context creates a causal link between being near Little and being in danger, so White should be afraid to come back to Little to avoid this danger.
* The statement is a logical consequence of the context, as if White wants to live, he should avoid Little, and fear is a natural response to a perceived threat, making it reasonable for White to be afraid to come back.<|eot_id|>
