* The statement implies White should be afraid, but the context suggests White should be trying to get away from Little, implying a sense of urgency or danger, rather than fear.
* The context implies White's priority is survival, and getting away from Little is necessary for that, rather than being motivated by fear.
* The statement assumes White is considering coming back to Little, but the context suggests White should be doing the opposite, getting as far away as possible.
* The context implies a sense of self-preservation, where White's actions are driven by a desire to live, rather than fear of coming back to Little.
* The statement is too vague, as it doesn't specify what White should be afraid of, whereas the context implies the danger is related to being near Little.<|eot_id|>
