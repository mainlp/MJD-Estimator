* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but the context does not explicitly state "want to be sure", it implies it through "strive to ensure".
* The context mentions "efficiently and effectively support mission-related outcomes", but the statement only mentions "successful", which is a broader term.
* The context focuses on "core processes", while the statement only mentions "processes", which could be more general.
* The context implies a sense of effort or intention ("strive to ensure"), while the statement is more declarative ("want to be sure").
* The context provides more specific information about the desired outcome ("mission-related outcomes"), while the statement is more vague ("successful").<|eot_id|>
