* The statement is too vague, as "successful" is not equivalent to "efficiently and effectively support mission-related outcomes".
* The statement omits the crucial aspect of "core processes" mentioned in the context.
* The statement uses "want to be sure" which is a weaker claim than "strive to ensure" in the context.
* The statement does not convey the same level of importance and focus on "mission-related outcomes" as the context does.<|eot_id|>
