Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* "strive to ensure" implies a desire or intention to achieve something, which in this case is that their core processes support mission-related outcomes, and this is equivalent to wanting to be sure their processes are successful.
* "efficiently and effectively" implies a sense of success or achievement, and the fact that leading organizations want their processes to be efficient and effective means they want them to be successful.
* The phrase "support mission-related outcomes" implies that the processes are intended to achieve certain goals or outcomes, and wanting to ensure they do so means wanting them to be successful.
* The context implies that leading organizations are proactive and goal-oriented, and therefore they would naturally want their processes to be successful.<|eot_id|>
