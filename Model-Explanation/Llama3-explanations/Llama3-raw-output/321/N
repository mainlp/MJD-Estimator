Statement: We need to wait until they tell us what to do. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context does not provide enough information about what "they" refers to, making it unclear whether waiting for their instruction is necessary or not.
* The context expresses a sense of finality ("just hang up") and a lack of obligation ("don't think we have to do anything else"), which contradicts the idea of needing to wait for further instruction.
* The statement implies a sense of dependency on external direction, which is not supported by the context's tone of independence and decisiveness.
* The context does not provide any information about the current state of the situation, making it impossible to determine whether waiting is necessary or not.
* The statement's tone is cautious and hesitant, which contrasts with the context's more assertive and decisive tone.
* The context does not provide any information about the consequences of not waiting, making it impossible to determine whether waiting is necessary or not.<|eot_id|>
