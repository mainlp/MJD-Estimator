Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The subject of the sentence is "they", but the context only mentions Julius, implying that "they" might refer to a different group of people.
* The verb tense in the statement is future ("will come back"), but the context suggests that the event has already happened ("It's come back").
* The statement implies that someone has announced that it will come back, but the context only shows Julius' excited reaction, without mentioning anyone else making an announcement.
* The context suggests that Julius is excited because it has already come back, whereas the statement implies that they are excited about a future event.<|eot_id|>
