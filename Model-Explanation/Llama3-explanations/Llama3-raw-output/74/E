Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The park was given Corbett's name after India became independent, implying that it had a different name before independence.
* The renaming of the park was a direct consequence of India gaining independence.
* The park's original name was replaced with Corbett's name as a result of India becoming independent.
