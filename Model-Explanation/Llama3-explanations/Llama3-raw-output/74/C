* The park was given Corbett's name, not changed to a new name.
* The park was established in 1935, and the name change occurred after India became independent, implying that the park already existed before the independence.
* The name change was not a result of the independence, but rather a consequence of it (i.e., it was given Corbett's name after independence, not because of independence).<|eot_id|>
