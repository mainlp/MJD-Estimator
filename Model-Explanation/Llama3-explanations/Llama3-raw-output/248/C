* The word "walloped" connotes a sense of force or violence, which is not consistent with hitting with a spoon.
* The context suggests a serious or severe reason for crying, but hitting with a spoon is not a serious or severe action.
* The tone of the context is one of distress or upset, but hitting with a spoon is not typically associated with causing distress or upset.
