* The context only provides a possibility (may have been named) but does not confirm the reason for the naming.
* The statement assumes a specific reason (same bright red color) which is not explicitly stated in the context.
* The context mentions "prominent red protuberances" but does not specify if the entire body is bright red.
* The context does not rule out other possible reasons for the naming, such as cultural or historical associations with redcoats.
* The statement is too specific and definitive, whereas the context is more tentative and uncertain.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the exact reason for the naming.<|eot_id|>
