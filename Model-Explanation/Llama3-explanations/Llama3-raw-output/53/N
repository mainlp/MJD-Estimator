* The statement contradicts the context, which implies the ANC is expected to oversee land reform, but does not provide conclusive evidence to support or refute the statement.
* The context only mentions unmet expectations, but does not explicitly state the ANC is not in charge of land reform.
* The statement is a negation of an expectation, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the expectation was actually fulfilled or not.
* The context focuses on unmet expectations, but does not provide a clear indication of the current state of land reform or the ANC's role in it.
* The statement is a categorical negation, but the context only provides a vague sense of disappointment or unfulfilled expectations, without providing a clear confirmation or denial of the statement.<|eot_id|>
