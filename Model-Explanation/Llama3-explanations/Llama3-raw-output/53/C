* The context explicitly states that there were "expectations that the ANC would oversee land reform", implying that the ANC was expected to be in charge of land reform.
* The phrase "the ANC would oversee land reform" in the context contradicts the statement "The ANC would not be in charge of land reform".
* The context does not provide any information that suggests the ANC would not be responsible for land reform, but rather the opposite.
* The statement is a direct negation of the expectation mentioned in the context.<|eot_id|>
