* The context only mentions Wallace winning his last race for governor, but does not specify if it was a reelection or not.
* The context does not provide information about the type of election (primary or general) or the outcome of the general election.
* The phrase "last race for governor" is ambiguous and could imply that Wallace did not run for governor again, but it does not explicitly state that he was reelected.
* The context focuses on the percentage of black votes cast in the Democratic primary, which does not necessarily imply that Wallace won the general election or was reelected.
* The written epilogue at the end of the film is mentioned, but its content is not specified, and it may not provide information about Wallace's reelection.<|eot_id|>
