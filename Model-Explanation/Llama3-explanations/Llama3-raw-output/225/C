* "Rose" and "stood up" are synonyms, but "rose" implies a change from a lower to a higher position, whereas "stood up" implies a change from a sitting position, which is not necessarily the case in the context.
* The context only mentions "Tuppence rose", which could mean Tuppence's value or popularity increased, rather than a physical action of standing up.
* The context does not provide any information about Tuppence's initial position, so it cannot be inferred that Tuppence was sitting or lying down before rising.
* "Rose" could be a metaphorical or figurative expression, whereas "stood up" is a literal physical action, which may not be equivalent in this context.<|eot_id|>
