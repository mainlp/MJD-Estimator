* "Rose" is a synonym for "stood up", implying that Tuppence changed from a seated to a standing position.
* The phrase "Tuppence rose" implies a physical action of getting up from a seated or lying down position, which means Tuppence stood up.
* "Rose" can be interpreted as "got up", which is equivalent to standing up, so Tuppence stood up.
* The context suggests that Tuppence was previously in a seated or recumbent position and then changed to a standing position, which is described by the statement "Tuppence stood up".
* The verb "rose" implies upward motion, which in this context means Tuppence moved from a lower to a higher position, resulting in standing up.<|eot_id|>
