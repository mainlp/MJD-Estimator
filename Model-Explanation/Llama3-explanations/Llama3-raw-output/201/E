Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context mentions "northwestern Alpine frontier", implying a geographical location, and the Alpine frontier is known to have glaciers.
* The term "Alpine" is often associated with mountains and glaciers, so it is likely that the Alpine frontier has glaciers.
* The context does not explicitly state that the Alpine frontier is part of Italy, suggesting that it might be a separate geographical entity, which could be separated from Italy by glaciers.
* The phrase "on the scene" implies a sense of distance or separation, which could be due to the presence of glaciers between the Alpine frontier and Italy.<|eot_id|>
