* The context does not provide any information about the geographical features of the Alpine frontier, making it impossible to determine if it was separated from Italy by glaciers.
* There is no mention of glaciers in the context, so it cannot be inferred that the Alpine frontier was or was not separated from Italy by glaciers.
* The context focuses on the emergence of a new state and its role in the unification of Italy, but does not provide any details about the geography of the region.
* The statement is making a claim about a specific geographical feature (glaciers) that is not addressed in the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to support or contradict the statement, leaving it undetermined.
* The statement is introducing new information that is not present in the context, making it impossible to determine its truth value based on the provided context.<|eot_id|>
