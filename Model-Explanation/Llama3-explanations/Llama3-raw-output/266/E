1. Twisting someone's wrist implies physical contact, which requires grabbing or holding onto the person.
2. The action of twisting a wrist is a specific type of grabbing or grasping, so grabbing is a more general action that encompasses twisting.
3. To twist someone's wrist, Jon must have had a firm grip on the man's wrist, which means he was grabbing it.
4. The context implies a physical altercation, and grabbing is a common action in such situations, making it a plausible inference.
