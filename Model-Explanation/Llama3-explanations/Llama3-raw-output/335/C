Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions the second half, but not the first part, so we can't infer what the first part dealt with.
* The context doesn't provide any information about the first part, so we can't assume it dealt with false names.
* The context only talks about the "true name", but doesn't mention "false names" at all, so we can't infer the first part dealt with it.
* The statement is making an assumption about the first part, which is not supported by the context.
* The context doesn't provide a clear contrast between the two halves, so we can't infer that the first part dealt with the opposite of the second half.<|eot_id|>
