* The statement implies a possibility of change, but the context states a fact about variation, not potential change.
* The context describes a difference between agencies, whereas the statement does not specify any comparison or difference.
* The context uses "vary considerably" which implies a current state, whereas the statement uses "might change" which implies a potential future state.
