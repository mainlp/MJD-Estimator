* The sentence is in the context of a hypothetical scenario, and Steve Jobs did not actually come back to Apple.
* Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and cannot come back to Apple.
* The sentence is a counterfactual statement, meaning it is describing a situation that is opposite of what actually happened.
* The comparison to bringing Gen. [someone] implies that Steve Jobs is not currently at Apple, and the idea of bringing him back is fictional.
* The sentence is a thought experiment or a "what if" scenario, rather than a statement of fact.<|eot_id|>
