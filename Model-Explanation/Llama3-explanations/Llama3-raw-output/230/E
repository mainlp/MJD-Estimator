Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context explicitly states that bringing Steve Jobs back to save Apple is comparable to bringing Gen. [someone], implying that Steve Jobs did come back to Apple.
* The analogy would not make sense if Steve Jobs had not come back to Apple, as there would be no basis for comparison.
* The phrase "bringing Steve Jobs back" suggests that Steve Jobs had previously left Apple and then returned, which is a historical fact.
* The context assumes a shared knowledge of Steve Jobs' history with Apple, including his departure and subsequent return.<|eot_id|>
