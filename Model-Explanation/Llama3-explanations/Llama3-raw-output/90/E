Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The speaker explicitly mentions watching a frivolous show (Knots Landing) on Thursday nights.
* The speaker implies that they have a regular routine of watching TV on Thursday nights at 9 o'clock after aerobics.
* The speaker does not mention watching any non-frivolous shows on Thursday nights.
* The speaker's hesitation and difficulty in thinking of other shows they watch suggests that Thursday night frivolous shows might be a significant part of their TV routine.<|eot_id|>
