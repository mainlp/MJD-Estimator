* The speaker mentions watching "some of those frivolous things" implying they watch other frivolous things beyond Thursday nights.
* The speaker says "some of the others" which suggests they watch other types of shows beyond frivolous ones.
* The speaker mentions watching Knots Landing specifically on Thursday nights at 9 o'clock, implying they may watch other shows at different times.
* The use of "although" in the context suggests that the speaker's watching habits are not limited to Thursday nights or frivolous things.
* The speaker mentions getting home from aerobics, which may imply they have other activities or watching habits outside of Thursday nights.<|eot_id|>
