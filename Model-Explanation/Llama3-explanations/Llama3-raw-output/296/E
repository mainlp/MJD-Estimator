Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* If agencies need sound financial information to manage better, then agencies without it will not manage better.
* Relying on unsound financial information implies a lack of sound financial information, which is necessary for managing better.
* Managing better requires sound financial information, so its absence will lead to management problems.
* The absence of sound financial information will hinder an agency's ability to manage, resulting in management problems.
* If sound financial information is necessary for managing better, then its opposite (unsound financial information) will lead to the opposite outcome (management problems).
* The context implies that sound financial information is a prerequisite for good management, so its absence will lead to management problems.<|eot_id|>
