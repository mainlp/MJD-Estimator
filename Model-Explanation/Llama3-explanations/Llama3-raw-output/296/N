Statement: Agencies that rely on information based on unsound financial information will have management problems. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions the importance of sound financial information, but does not explicitly state what happens when agencies rely on unsound financial information.
* The context does not provide a direct causal link between relying on unsound financial information and having management problems.
* The statement is a hypothetical scenario that is not directly addressed in the context.
* The context focuses on the positive aspect of having sound financial information, but does not provide information about the negative consequences of not having it.
* The statement is a logical inference, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it.
* The context does not define what "management problems" are, making it unclear whether they are a direct result of relying on unsound financial information.<|eot_id|>
