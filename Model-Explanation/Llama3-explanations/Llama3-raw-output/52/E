* The village is named after Sainte-Marie, which is not the explorer's name.
* The village is named by the explorer, but not after himself, rather after something or someone else (e.g. Sainte-Marie).
* The explorer did not settle in the village, he only landed there, implying that the village was not named after him as a settler.<|eot_id|>
