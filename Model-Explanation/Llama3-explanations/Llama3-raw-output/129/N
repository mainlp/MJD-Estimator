* The context only provides information about the price of preprints, but not about the fairness of the price or people's opinions about it.
* There is no explicit connection between the low marginal costs and the fairness of the prices.
* The context does not provide any information about the perspective or opinions of "many people" or "new printers".
* The statement makes a claim about people's opinions, but the context does not provide any evidence or support for this claim.
* The context only discusses the potential price of preprints, but not the potential impact of this price on new printers or their perception of fairness.
* The statement introduces a new concept ("unfair") that is not mentioned or implied in the context.
* The context does not provide any information about the current prices or the prices that new printers are expecting, which makes it difficult to determine if the prices are unfair or not.<|eot_id|>
