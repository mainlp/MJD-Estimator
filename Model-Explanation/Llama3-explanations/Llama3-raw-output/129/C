* The context does not mention anything about new printers, it only talks about preprints.
* The prices mentioned (5 or 6 cents per piece) are very low, which might be considered fair or even beneficial to new printers.
* There is no information provided about the opinions of people regarding these prices, so it cannot be inferred that many people consider them unfair.
* The context focuses on the low marginal costs, which might suggest that the prices are reasonable, not unfair.<|eot_id|>
