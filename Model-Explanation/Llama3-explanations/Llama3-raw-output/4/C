* The speaker does not find plastic easy to use, but rather thinks it is a problem that others find it too easy to use.
* The speaker is being sarcastic, and "too easy" is meant to convey the opposite, that plastic is actually difficult to use.
* The speaker is not talking about their personal experience or opinion, but rather making a general statement about the nature of plastic.
* The phrase "that's the whole problem with it" implies that the ease of use is a negative aspect, which contradicts the statement that the speaker finds it easy to use.
* The speaker is using "too easy" to mean that plastic is overly convenient, leading to laziness or lack of effort, which is not something they personally find desirable.<|eot_id|>
