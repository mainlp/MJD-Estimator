You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases.

Statement: Newspaper preprints can cost as much as $5.

* The context only provides a lower bound for the price of newspaper preprints (5 or 6 cents), but does not provide an upper bound, so it is unknown if the price can be as high as $5.
* The context suggests that the price is likely to be low due to low marginal costs, but it does not rule out the possibility of a higher price.
* The statement is making a claim about the maximum possible price, which is not addressed in the context.
* The context is discussing a specific scenario (preprints) and the statement is making a general claim about newspaper preprints, which may not be applicable to the specific scenario.
* The context is providing a specific estimate (5 or 6 cents) and the statement is making a claim about a much higher price, which may not be related to the estimate provided.<|eot_id|>
