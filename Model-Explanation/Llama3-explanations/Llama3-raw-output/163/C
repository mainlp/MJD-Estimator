* The statement implies a high cost, but the context suggests a low cost.
* The context mentions a price of 5 or 6 cents, which is significantly lower than $5.
* The context implies that the cost is low due to marginal costs being very low, which contradicts the statement's high cost.
* The statement's cost is 83-100 times higher than the cost mentioned in the context.
* The context's cost is in cents, while the statement's cost is in dollars, indicating a large discrepancy.<|eot_id|>
