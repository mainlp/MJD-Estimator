Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The scribbled words on the envelope mentioned the creation of a new will.
* The scribbled words on the envelope indicated that a will was made recently, and "yesterday afternoon" is a recent time.
* Poirot's smile implies that he found a clever clue in the scribbled words that led him to the conclusion.
* The context implies that Poirot is a skilled detective who can make connections between seemingly unrelated information, including the scribbled words on the envelope.
* The phrase "how did those scribbled words... help you to discover" implies that the scribbled words contained some information that contributed to Poirot's discovery.
* The fact that Poirot is being asked to explain his reasoning implies that he has already made the connection between the scribbled words and the new will.<|eot_id|>
