* The vibration and humming are mutually exclusive, and since it vibrated, it did not hum.
* The vibration implies a more intense or violent motion, whereas humming is a softer sound, so they are inconsistent.
* The context only mentions vibration, but not humming, so the statement is not supported by the context.
* The phrase "under his hand" in the context implies a sense of containment or restriction, which is not compatible with the idea of humming quietly.
* The context suggests a sudden or brief movement (vibration), whereas humming implies a more sustained sound, which is a contradiction.<|eot_id|>
