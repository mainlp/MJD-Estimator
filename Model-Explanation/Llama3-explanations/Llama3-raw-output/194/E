Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context does not mention the Trump Tower, so it cannot be inferred to have ornate décor.
* The context only recommends the Gaiety Theatre for its ornate décor, implying that other places, including the Trump Tower, may not have similar décor.
* The Trump Tower is not mentioned as a place with ornate décor, so it is unlikely to be a good place to visit for that reason.
* The context highlights the Gaiety Theatre's ornate décor as a unique feature, suggesting that other places, including the Trump Tower, may lack this feature.
* The Trump Tower is not equivalent to the Gaiety Theatre in terms of ornate décor, so it cannot be a good place to visit for that reason.<|eot_id|>
