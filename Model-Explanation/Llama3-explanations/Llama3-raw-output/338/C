You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Then you're ready for the fray, either in the bustling great bazaars such as Delhi's Chandni Chowk or Mumbai's Bhuleshwar, or the more sedate ambience of grander shops and showrooms. 
Statement: All of the great bazaars are bustling at all times.

* The context mentions "or the more sedate ambience of grander shops and showrooms", implying that not all shopping areas are bustling.
* The phrase "bustling great bazaars" is used to contrast with "more sedate ambience", suggesting that not all great bazaars are always bustling.
* The use of "such as" to introduce examples of great bazaars (Chandni Chowk and Bhuleshwar) implies that these are specific instances, and not all great bazaars are like them.
* The context does not provide any information that would suggest all great bazaars are always bustling, and it is unlikely that this would be the case in reality.<|eot_id|>
