You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Then you're ready for the fray, either in the bustling great bazaars such as Delhi's Chandni Chowk or Mumbai's Bhuleshwar, or the more sedate ambience of grander shops and showrooms. 
Statement: All of the great bazaars are bustling at all times. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions two specific bazaars (Chandni Chowk and Bhuleshwar) as being bustling, but does not provide information about all great bazaars.
* The context contrasts "bustling great bazaars" with "grander shops and showrooms" which have a "more sedate ambience", implying that not all great bazaars are bustling.
* The context does not provide a universal statement about great bazaars, only describing two specific examples.
* The statement assumes a universal quantifier ("all") which is not supported by the context.
* The context focuses on the reader being "ready for the fray" in these bazaars, rather than making a claim about the bazaars themselves.<|eot_id|>
