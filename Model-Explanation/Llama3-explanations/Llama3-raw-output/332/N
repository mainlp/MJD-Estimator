You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The NYT, in its front-page coverage, says the plane was flying far lower than the rules for training missions allow. 
Statement: The NYT reported that training missions did allow for planes to fly that low.

* The statement contradicts the context, which implies that the plane was flying lower than allowed for training missions.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the NYT reported that training missions allow for planes to fly that low.
* The context only mentions what the NYT reported about the plane's altitude, not what it reported about the rules for training missions.
* The statement is making a claim about what the NYT reported, but the context does not provide direct evidence to support or refute this claim.
* The context and the statement are talking about different aspects of the NYT's report (altitude vs. rules for training missions).
* The statement is not a logical consequence of the context, and the context does not provide enough information to infer the statement.<|eot_id|>
