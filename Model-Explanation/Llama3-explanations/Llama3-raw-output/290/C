Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The actual volume growth (13) is higher than the expected increase (10).
* The expected increase (10) is lower than the actual volume growth (13).
* The statement does not match the context, as the context reports an actual growth of 13, while the statement mentions an expected increase of 10.
* The context implies a positive difference between the actual and expected growth, which contradicts the statement.
* The statement's expected increase is not consistent with the context's reported growth.
* The actual outcome (13) does not align with the predicted outcome (10).
* The context and statement provide conflicting information about the volume growth.<|eot_id|>
