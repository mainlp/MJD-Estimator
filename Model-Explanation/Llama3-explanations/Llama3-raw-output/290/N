You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Total volume grew 13. 
Statement: The expected increase was 10. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The statement only provides the expected increase, but not the actual increase, so it's unclear if the total volume grew more or less than expected.
* The actual growth (13) is not explicitly compared to the expected growth (10), leaving the relationship between the two unclear.
* The statement doesn't indicate if the difference between the expected and actual growth is significant or not.
* There is no information about the unit of measurement, so it's unclear if the difference between 13 and 10 is substantial.
* The context only provides a single data point, making it difficult to determine if the actual growth is more or less than expected based on this one instance.
* The statement doesn't provide any additional context or information about the expectations, such as the basis for the expectation or the confidence level.<|eot_id|>
