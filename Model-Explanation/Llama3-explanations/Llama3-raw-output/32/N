* The context only provides a thought or speculation, but not a confirmed fact, so it's uncertain whether the architect was actually used or not.
* The context and statement are contradictory, but neither provides conclusive evidence, leaving the truth uncertain.
* The context is a rumor or hearsay, while the statement is a factual claim, but without further evidence, it's unclear which one is true.
* The context is an opinion or belief, while the statement is a contradictory opinion or belief, and without more information, it's impossible to determine which one is correct.
* The context is a hypothesis or speculation, while the statement is a contradictory hypothesis or speculation, and without further investigation, it's unclear which one is true.
