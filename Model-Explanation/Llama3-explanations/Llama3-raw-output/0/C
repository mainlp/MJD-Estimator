Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context mentions "ladies" but the statement says "small lepers", which are different entities.
* The context does not mention "lepers" at all, implying they are not present in the scene.
* The context describes the ladies as expertly chopping, but the statement does not provide any information about the lepers' expertise.
* The context mentions "large machetes" but the statement does not mention the tool used by the lepers.
* The context mentions "kingfish, tuna, or shark" as the types of fish being chopped, but the statement only mentions "tuna".
* The context does not imply that the ladies are chopping fish because they have no other place to work, whereas the statement suggests that the lepers are chopping fish because it's the only place they can work.<|eot_id|>
