* The context does not imply that the ladies are lepers.
* The context does not mention that the ladies are small.
* The context does not imply that the ladies are only able to work in this specific place.
* The context mentions "kingfish, tuna, or shark" as the types of fish being chopped, but does not imply that tuna is the only type of fish being chopped.
* The context does not provide any information about the employment opportunities or restrictions for people with leprosy.<|eot_id|>
