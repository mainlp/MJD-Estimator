* The context does not mention cat fur at all, making it impossible to infer whether NIPA considers it or not.
* There is no logical connection between capital gains on existing assets and cat fur.
* The context focuses on the relationship between capital gains and savings in NIPA, while the statement introduces an unrelated concept (cat fur).
* The statement is a non-sequitur, making it impossible to determine its truth value based on the provided context.
* The context does not provide any information about what NIPA considers or does not consider when defining savings, except for capital gains on existing assets.
* Cat fur is not a relevant or plausible factor in the definition of savings in NIPA.<|eot_id|>
