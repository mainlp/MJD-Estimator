1. The statement is a paraphrased version of the context, using synonyms and rephrasing to convey the same meaning.
2. The context explicitly mentions a "square court with arches", which is equivalent to a "wonderful square court, complete with arches".
3. The word "houses" is a synonym for "is built around", implying that the palace contains or features the described square court.
4. The context does not provide any contradictory information, making the statement a logical inference.
5. The statement is a more descriptive and embellished version of the context, but it does not add any new or conflicting information.
6. The use of the word "wonderful" is an subjective evaluation, but it does not change the factual content of the statement, which is still supported by the context.<|eot_id|>
