Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The Pakistani government had promised compensation to poppy growers for switching to other crops, implying that growing opium is not allowed.
* The editorial in Dawn reports on the plans of Pakistani poppy growers to recultivate opium, suggesting that it is not a legal activity.
* The need for compensation for switching to other crops implies that growing opium is not a permitted activity in Pakistan.
* The fact that the growers are planning to recultivate opium on a bigger scale suggests that they are trying to circumvent the law or take advantage of a loophole, implying that growing opium is illegal.
* The context implies that the Pakistani government has discouraged or banned opium cultivation, which is why the growers are seeking compensation for switching to other crops.<|eot_id|>
