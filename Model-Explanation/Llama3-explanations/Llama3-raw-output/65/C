Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* Pakistani poppy growers are planning to recultivate opium, implying that it is not illegal to grow opium in Pakistan.
* If growing opium were illegal, the growers would not be planning to recultivate it on a bigger scale.
* The editorial in Dawn reports on the plans of Pakistani poppy growers to recultivate opium, suggesting that the activity is not prohibited.
* The growers are seeking compensation for switching to other crops, implying that growing opium was previously allowed or tolerated.
* The fact that the growers are seeking compensation implies that they were initially allowed to grow opium and are now seeking restitution for changing their crops.<|eot_id|>
