* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but it's not clear if it's a direct consequence or a related idea.
* The context mentions "the cost" without specifying what cost, while the statement specifies "the cost of fixing it", which might be a subset of the original cost.
* The context uses "almost prohibitive" to describe the cost, while the statement uses "makes it hard", which are similar but not identical sentiments.
* The context implies that the cost is a major obstacle, while the statement only says it's a contributing factor.
* The statement could be seen as a more general statement about the cost of fixing something, rather than a direct reference to the context.
* The context and statement have different grammatical structures, which might affect their meaning and relationship.<|eot_id|>
