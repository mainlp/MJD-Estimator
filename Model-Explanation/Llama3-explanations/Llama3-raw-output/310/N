Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions signing up for majors at the end of sophomore year, but does not provide information about freshman year.
* There is no explicit statement or implication that contradicts or supports the requirement to sign up for a major freshman year.
* The context focuses on the speaker's career aspirations and their experience with chemistry, which is unrelated to the timing of signing up for a major.
* The speaker's use of "when we came time to sign up for majors" implies that signing up for majors is a process that occurs at some point, but does not specify when that point is.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the speaker's institution requires signing up for a major freshman year or not.<|eot_id|>
