* The statement is false, as the context explicitly states "until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors", implying that majors are chosen at the end of sophomore year, not freshman year.
* The context does not provide any information that suggests signing up for a major is a freshman year requirement.<|eot_id|>
