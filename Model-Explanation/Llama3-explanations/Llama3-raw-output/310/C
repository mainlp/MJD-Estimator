* The context states that the speaker "came time to sign up for majors" at the end of their sophomore year, implying that signing up for a major did not occur freshman year.
* The speaker's experience of taking chemistry for the first time in their sophomore year and then deciding on a major suggests that they had not declared a major prior to that point.
* The narrative implies a sequence of events where the speaker initially wanted to be a teacher, but then discovered their aptitude for chemistry in sophomore year, which led to a change in their plans; this sequence would not be possible if they had already declared a major freshman year.<|eot_id|>
