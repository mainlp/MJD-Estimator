* The context and statement are contradictory, but the context does not provide enough information to prove or disprove the statement.
* The context only mentions the consequence of the rules being issued as interim rules, but does not provide definitive evidence that they were indeed issued as such.
* The statement is the negation of the context, but the context does not contain a categorical assertion that the rules were issued as interim rules.
* There is no explicit evidence in the context that confirms or denies the statement.
* The context only discusses the implications of the rules being issued as interim rules, but does not provide a direct confirmation of the fact.
* The statement is not logically entailed or contradicted by the context, as it is a separate claim that requires additional evidence to be verified.<|eot_id|>
