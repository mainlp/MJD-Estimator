* The context describes Osmin's behavior as "rantings", which implies a state of agitation or anger, contradicting the idea of being "calm and collected".
* The use of "rantings" suggests a loud, intense, and possibly emotional outburst, which is incompatible with being "calm and collected".
* The context highlights the thrilling nature of Osmin's behavior, implying a level of energy and passion that is inconsistent with being "calm and collected".
* The contrast between "marvelous" singing and "thrilling" rantings implies that Osmin's behavior was more intense or dramatic than calm and collected.<|eot_id|>
