You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: My unborn children will never appear on the Today show. 
Statement: No direct descendent of mine will ever be a guest of the Today show. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

1. The statement is a direct paraphrase of the context, with "unborn children" being equivalent to "direct descendants".
2. The context implies that the speaker's unborn children will not appear on the Today show, and since they are the only possible direct descendants, none of them will be a guest.
3. The context sets a restriction on the speaker's unborn children, and this restriction is inherited by all their direct descendants, making it impossible for them to appear on the Today show.
4. The statement is a logical extension of the context, as "unborn children" is a subset of "direct descendants", and if the former will never appear on the show, neither will the latter.
5. The context implies a permanent and universal restriction on the speaker's offspring, which includes all direct descendants, making it impossible for any of them to be a guest on the Today show.<|eot_id|>
