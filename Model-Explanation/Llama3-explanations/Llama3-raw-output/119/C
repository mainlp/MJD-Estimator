* The speaker mentions "small colleges that I'm sure are struggling", implying that not all small colleges have trouble with funding and resources.
* The speaker contrasts "higher level education" with "small colleges", suggesting that the former is "pretty much funded well", implying that small colleges might not be representative of the general trend in higher education.
* The speaker's tone and language ("I'm sure are struggling") convey a sense of uncertainty or exception, rather than a general rule.
* The phrase "I don't think there's so much of a problem there" suggests that the speaker does not believe funding is a widespread issue in higher education, which contradicts the idea that small colleges usually have trouble with funding and resources.<|eot_id|>
