* The statement does not provide enough information to determine whether Kom Ombo is rarely visited or not, as the context only mentions its uniqueness in being dedicated to two gods.
* The context does not imply a correlation between being dedicated to two gods and being rarely visited or strange.
* The statement's use of "rarely visited" and "strange" is not explicitly supported or contradicted by the context, which only describes the temple as "unusual".
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the frequency of visits to Kom Ombo.
* The statement's tone and language ("rarely visited", "strange") may be subjective and not necessarily implied by the context.
* The context only provides information about the temple's dedication, not its popularity or visitor frequency.<|eot_id|>
