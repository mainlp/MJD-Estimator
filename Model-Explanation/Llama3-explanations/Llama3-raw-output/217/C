* "Rarely visited" contradicts the context, which does not mention anything about the temple's popularity or visitor frequency.
* "a strange temple" is a paraphrase of "an unusual temple", but the context does not imply that the temple's strangeness/unusualness is due to being devoted to two gods.
* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but the added information "Rarely visited" makes the statement not entirely equivalent to the context.<|eot_id|>
