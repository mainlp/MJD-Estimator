Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context does not explicitly state that the speaker's generation has no debt, but rather discusses the hypothetical scenario where their generation lives without debt.
* The speaker's tone is more focused on the potential benefits of living without debt for the next generation, rather than expressing gladness about their current situation.
* The context highlights the sacrifices that would be required to live without debt, such as not being able to own certain automobiles or homes, which might not be a desirable situation for the speaker.
* The speaker's statement "we wouldn't be destitute" implies that living without debt would still involve some level of financial constraint, which might not be a cause for gladness.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the speaker's current debt situation or their emotional response to it.<|eot_id|>
