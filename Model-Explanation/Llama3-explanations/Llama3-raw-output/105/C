2. If Julius already knew the answer, he wouldn't be asking the question "Answer?".
3. The context suggests Julius is seeking information, which contradicts the idea that he already knew the answer.
4. The tone of the question "Answer?" implies uncertainty or a lack of knowledge, contradicting the statement that Julius already knew the answer.
5. The fact that Julius is asking a question indicates he is not aware of the answer, contradicting the statement that he already knew it.<|eot_id|>
