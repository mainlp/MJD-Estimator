* The context only mentions "education and training programs" without specifying "college programs" which might have different characteristics or requirements.
* The context emphasizes "national economic productive capacity" which might not be the primary goal of college programs.
* The context requires reporting as "investments in human capital" which might not be the primary purpose of calculating net cost for college programs.
* The context is specific to the Federal Government and its component units, whereas college programs might be offered by private institutions or state governments.
* The context mentions "required supplementary stewardship information" which might imply a specific reporting requirement that does not apply to college programs.
* The statement does not mention the reporting requirement as part of the calculation, which is a crucial aspect of the context.<|eot_id|>
