* There is no mention of tombs or the dead in the context, making it unclear if Sphinxes were associated with them.
* The description of the Sphinxes as monumental protection does not necessarily imply they were used to protect the dead.
* The context focuses on the physical characteristics of the Sphinxes (length and height), but does not provide information about their function or purpose.
* The statement makes a specific claim about the purpose of Sphinxes, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny it.
* The context only provides general information about Sphinxes, but does not provide specific details about their role in ancient Egyptian funerary practices.<|eot_id|>
