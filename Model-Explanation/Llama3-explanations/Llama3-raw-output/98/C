* The context states that Sphinxes were monumental protection, implying they were large structures, whereas being placed in tombs would require them to be smaller.
* The context describes Sphinxes as standing 73m long and 20m high, which is too large to fit inside tombs.
* The context portrays Sphinxes as guardian deities, suggesting they were meant to protect something external, not internal like tombs.
* The context does not mention anything about Sphinxes being associated with tombs or the dead, contradicting the statement.<|eot_id|>
