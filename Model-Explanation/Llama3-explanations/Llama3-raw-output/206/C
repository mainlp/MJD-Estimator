You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases.

Statement: We were never assured of it happening in time and we knew this full well. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* "always knew" implies a sense of certainty, which contradicts "never assured"
* "outside chance" implies a low probability, but "knew this full well" implies a high degree of confidence
* The context suggests a sense of uncertainty, but the statement claims they knew it wouldn't happen in time, which is a more definitive statement
* The phrase "full well" implies a strong sense of awareness, which contradicts the context's implication of uncertainty.<|eot_id|>
