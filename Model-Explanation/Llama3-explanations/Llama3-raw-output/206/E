Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The phrase "outside chance" implies a low probability of occurrence, which means there was no assurance of it happening in time.
* The context suggests that the uncertainty was acknowledged beforehand, which is consistent with not being assured of it happening in time.
* The phrase "we always knew" in the context implies that the lack of assurance was a prior understanding, which is equivalent to knowing it full well.
* The context's tone of resignation or low expectation implies that the outcome was not guaranteed, which aligns with not being assured of it happening in time.
* The phrase "outside chance" implies that the event was not a certainty, which means there was no guarantee it would happen in time, and this lack of guarantee was known beforehand.<|eot_id|>
