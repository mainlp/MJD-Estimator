Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The speaker is complaining about high taxes, implying they wish they were lower.
* The phrase "our taxes sure is high" expresses dissatisfaction, which suggests the speaker wishes for lower taxes.
* The tone of the context, which is informal and conversational, implies a sense of frustration, leading to the inference that the speaker wishes for lower taxes.
* The use of the phrase "isn't it" is a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker takes it as a given that the taxes are high and undesirable, and therefore wishes they were lower.
* The context implies that the appraisers' liking something (likely the high valuation of a property) is the cause of the high taxes, and the speaker wishes this were not the case, i.e., they wish the taxes were lower.<|eot_id|>
