Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context expresses a neutral/accepting tone towards high taxes, whereas the statement expresses a desire for lower taxes, creating a contrast that makes the relationship between the context and statement unclear.
* The context focuses on the appraiser's liking and the fact that taxes are high, without explicitly expressing a positive or negative sentiment, whereas the statement expresses a clear negative sentiment towards high taxes.
* The context uses phrases like "apparently" and "isn't it" which convey a sense of resignation or acceptance, whereas the statement expresses a desire for change, making the relationship between the two unclear.
* The context does not provide a clear opinion or stance on taxes, whereas the statement takes a clear stance, making it difficult to determine the relationship between the two.
* The context is more focused on the fact that taxes are high, whereas the statement is focused on the desire for lower taxes, creating a shift in focus that makes the relationship between the two unclear.<|eot_id|>
