* The context mentions "Renaissance details", implying that some original features from the Renaissance period are still present.
* The context encourages the reader to look for "grand doorways", suggesting that the doorways are notable for their original or historic character, rather than being completely remodeled.
* The context mentions "views into lovely courtyards", implying that the courtyards are being appreciated for their current state, which may include original or historic features.
* The statement contradicts the idea of preserving "Renaissance details" if all doorways and courtyards have been completely remodeled.
* The use of "completely remodeled" implies a thorough transformation, which would erase any remaining Renaissance character, contradicting the context's emphasis on appreciating such details.<|eot_id|>
