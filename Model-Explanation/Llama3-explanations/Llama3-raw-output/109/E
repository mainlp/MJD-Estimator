* There is no mention of remodeling in the context, so it cannot be inferred that all doorways and courtyards have been remodeled.
* The context only mentions "Renaissance details" and "grand doorways", but does not imply that they are original or have not been remodeled.
* The context focuses on observing and appreciating the details, doorways, and courtyards, but does not provide information about their history or renovation status.
* The statement is making an assumption that is not supported by the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to make a claim about the remodeling of doorways and courtyards.<|eot_id|>
