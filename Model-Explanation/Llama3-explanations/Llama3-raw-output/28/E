* There is no mention of a sword in the context, but it's possible that "axe" is being used to refer to a sword.
* The context only mentions an axe, but it's possible that he had a sword in his other hand.
* The sentence structure and wording are similar, so it's possible that "axe" and "sword" are being used interchangeably.
* The context doesn't explicitly state that he didn't have a sword, so it's possible that he did have one and used it.
* The focus is on the action of swinging at the brute, and the weapon used is not the primary concern, so it's possible that the statement is true even if the weapon is different.<|eot_id|>
