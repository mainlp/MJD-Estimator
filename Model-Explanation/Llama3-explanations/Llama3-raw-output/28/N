* The context does not mention a sword, so it is unknown if he has one.
* The context mentions an axe, but it does not rule out the possibility of him having a sword as well.
* The context describes his action as "came at the brute with the axe", but it does not specify that he used the axe to swing at the brute.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if he switched to a sword after approaching the brute with the axe.
* The context only describes his initial action, but it does not provide a complete account of the entire event, leaving room for other possibilities.
* There is no explicit contradiction between the context and the statement, but also no explicit confirmation.<|eot_id|>
