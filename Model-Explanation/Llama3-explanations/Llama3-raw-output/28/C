Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context states he came at the brute with the axe, not a sword.
* There is no mention of a sword in the context, only an axe.
* The context implies he used the axe as the weapon, not a sword.
* The action described in the context (coming at the brute with the axe) is incompatible with the action described in the statement (swinging at the brute with a sword).
* The context and statement describe two different weapons being used (axe and sword).<|eot_id|>
