Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context only mentions auditors from another country, not a globally managed governing body.
* The auditors are required to meet the professional qualifications of the country they are auditing in, not a global standard.
* There is no mention of a single governing body that all auditors report to.
* The context suggests that auditors may report to different governing bodies or authorities in different countries.
* The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions is mentioned as a source of acceptable standards, but it is not a governing body that auditors report to.
* The context implies that auditors are subject to the laws and regulations of the country they are auditing in, rather than a global governing body.<|eot_id|>
