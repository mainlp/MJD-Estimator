Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only discusses the professional qualifications and standards for auditors, but does not mention anything about a globally managed governing body.
* There is no information provided about the organizational structure or reporting lines of auditors.
* The context focuses on the country-specific laws and regulations, and international standards, but does not imply a global governing body.
* The statement makes a claim about a global governing body, which is not supported or contradicted by the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether auditors report to a globally managed governing body or not.
* The statement's claim about a globally managed governing body is not relevant to the context's discussion of professional qualifications and standards.<|eot_id|>
