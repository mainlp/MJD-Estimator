You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you 
Statement: It's just like a drug hangover but worse. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions a similarity between two things, but it doesn't provide enough information to determine if the statement is true or false.
* The phrase "you know if you" is ambiguous and could be referring to a personal experience or a general knowledge, making it unclear how to interpret the comparison.
* The statement uses a subjective qualifier "worse" which is dependent on individual perspectives and experiences, making it difficult to determine a clear truth value.
* The context doesn't provide a clear definition of what a "drug hangover" is, making it hard to determine if the comparison is accurate or not.
* The statement is making a comparison between two things, but it's unclear what specific aspects are being compared, making it difficult to determine if the statement is true or false.
* The tone of the statement is informal and conversational, which may indicate a subjective opinion rather than a factual claim.<|eot_id|>
