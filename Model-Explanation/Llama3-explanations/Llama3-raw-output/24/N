* The context only mentions salt, not pepper, so there is no information about pepper's production process.
* The context describes salt as "drying", implying a process of removing moisture, whereas the statement claims pepper is "made wet", which is an opposing process.
* The context does not provide any information about pepper being made or processed at Las Salinas, or anywhere else.
* The context does not imply or suggest that pepper is made using a similar process as salt, or that it is made at the same location.
* There is no logical connection between the context and the statement that would allow us to infer the truth or falsehood of the statement.<|eot_id|>
