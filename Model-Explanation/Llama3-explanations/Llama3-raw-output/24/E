* There is no mention of pepper being made or processed in Las Salinas, so the statement is not supported by the context.
* The context only talks about salt, not pepper, so it's unlikely that pepper is made wet in Las Salinas.
* The context describes salt as "drying" in Las Salinas, implying that the environment is dry, which contradicts the idea of pepper being made wet.
* There is no logical connection between the processing of salt and the processing of pepper in the given context.<|eot_id|>
