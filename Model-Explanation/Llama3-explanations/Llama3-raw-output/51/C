* The context highlights a historical event (proclamation of emancipation) that occurred in the house, but does not mention any incident of a king being murdered.
* The name "Old King's House" might be misleading, but it does not imply that a king lived or was murdered there.
* The context provides a specific date (1762) for the building of the house, but does not mention any incident of a king being murdered.
* The context focuses on the historical significance of the house as a residence of the British governor, not as a place where a king was murdered.<|eot_id|>
