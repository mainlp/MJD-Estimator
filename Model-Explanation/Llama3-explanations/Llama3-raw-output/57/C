* The system is not corrupt because the rule is clear and consistent: life and a day means no parole.
* The system is not corrupt because the distinction between life in prison and life and a day is a legitimate legal distinction.
* The system is not corrupt because the speaker is aware of the rule and is simply unhappy with it.
* The system is not corrupt because the rule may be based on a legitimate policy decision to deny parole in certain cases.
* The system is not corrupt because the speaker's frustration with the rule does not necessarily imply corruption.
* The system is not corrupt because the rule may be applied consistently and fairly in all similar cases.<|eot_id|>
