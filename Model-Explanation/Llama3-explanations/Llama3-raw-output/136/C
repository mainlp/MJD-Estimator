Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* "swelling" and "growing hot" are symptoms that do not necessarily imply burning
* "burning" typically implies a more intense or severe sensation than what is described
* "burning" might imply an external cause, whereas the context suggests an internal reaction
* "burning" could be a figurative expression, whereas the context is describing physical sensations
* The context only describes the skin as "swelling" and "growing hot", but does not explicitly state that it is burning.<|eot_id|>
