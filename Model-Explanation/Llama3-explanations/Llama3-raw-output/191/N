You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: will never be doused (Brit Hume, Fox News Sunday ; Tony Blankley, Late Edition ; Robert Novak, Capital Gang ; Tucker Carlson, The McLaughlin Group ). The middle way is best expressed by Howard Kurtz (NBC's Meet the Press )--he scolds Brill for undisclosed campaign contributions and for overstretching his legal case against Kenneth Starr but applauds him for casting light on the media. 
Statement: They wanted the public to know where the funds came from.

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context does not explicitly state the subject "they", making it unclear who wanted the public to know where the funds came from.
* The context mentions undisclosed campaign contributions, but it does not specify whether the contributors wanted to disclose the information or not.
* The statement could be referring to Brill, but the context only mentions that Howard Kurtz scolds Brill for undisclosed campaign contributions, without indicating Brill's intentions.
* The statement could also be referring to someone else, such as Howard Kurtz or the media in general, but there is no clear evidence in the context to support this interpretation.
* The context focuses on the media and their coverage of Kenneth Starr, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether "they" wanted to disclose the source of funds or not.
* The tone of the context is more focused on criticizing Brill and the media rather than providing information about their intentions regarding fund disclosure.<|eot_id|>
