You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: When he's ready for a major strike, how many innocents do you suppose are going to suffer? To quote one of your contemporaries; 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.''
Statement: He won't care how many innocent people will suffer. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

1. The context implies that "he" is willing to make a "major strike", which suggests a lack of concern for innocent people.
2. The quote "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" implies that "he" prioritizes the greater good over individual lives, including innocent people.
3. The question "how many innocents do you suppose are going to suffer" implies that suffering is expected, and "he" is not concerned about it.
4. The tone of the context is critical and warning, suggesting that "he" is callous and won't care about innocent people.
5. The use of "when he's ready" implies a sense of inevitability, and "he" is not going to be deterred by concerns about innocent people.<|eot_id|>
