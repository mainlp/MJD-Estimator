Here are possible explanations why the statement is not true (no entailment):

* The context only mentions "what makes a good school" which is a broader topic, whereas the statement specifically talks about "insane student loans" which is a narrower topic.
* There is no mention of "college students" or "student loans" in the context, which are key elements of the statement.
* The context focuses on the quality of schools, whereas the statement focuses on the financial burden of students.
* The context does not provide any information about the financial aspects of education, which is the main topic of the statement.
* The statement makes a specific claim about the content of Time's cover package, which is not supported by the context.<|eot_id|>
