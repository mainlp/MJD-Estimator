* The context states that larger ski resorts are 90 minutes away, implying that the largest resort is also 90 minutes away, but the statement claims it is 100 minutes away.
* The statement contradicts the context by providing a different distance (100 minutes) than the one mentioned in the context (90 minutes).
* The context sets a general rule or pattern (larger resorts are 90 minutes away), but the statement provides a specific exception or counterexample (the largest resort is 100 minutes away) that contradicts this rule.
* The statement implies that there is a larger resort that is farther away than the ones mentioned in the context, which contradicts the idea that larger resorts are 90 minutes away.<|eot_id|>
