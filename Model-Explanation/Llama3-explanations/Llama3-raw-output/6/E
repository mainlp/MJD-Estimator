Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only provides a lower bound for the distance to larger ski resorts, but does not provide an upper bound, so it is possible that the largest resort is farther away.
* The context does not specify the distance to the largest resort, only to larger resorts in general, so it is possible that the largest resort is an outlier.
* The context implies that there are multiple larger ski resorts, and the distance to the largest one could be different from the others.
* The statement provides more specific information about the largest resort, which is not contradicted by the context.
* The context only provides a general statement about larger resorts, but does not provide exact information about the largest one.<|eot_id|>
