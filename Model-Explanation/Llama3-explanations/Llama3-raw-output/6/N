Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only provides information about larger ski resorts, but not specifically about the largest resort.
* The context does not provide a clear upper bound for the distance of larger ski resorts.
* The statement provides new information that is not contradictory to the context, but rather provides a specific detail about the largest resort.
* The context does not imply that the largest resort is within the 90-minute range.
* The statement does not entail a clear logical consequence that can be determined as true or false based on the context.
* The context and statement are not mutually exclusive, but rather provide complementary information.
* There is no clear contradiction or entailment between the context and statement, making it difficult to determine a definitive true or false label.<|eot_id|>
