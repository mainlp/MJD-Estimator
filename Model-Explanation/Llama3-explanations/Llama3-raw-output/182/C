Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The verb "flow" implies a smooth and peaceful movement, whereas "roared" suggests a loud and turbulent sound, which are contradictory descriptions of the river's behavior.
* The context does not mention any noise or turbulence, implying a calm scene, whereas "roared" implies a loud and intense sound.
* The phrase "watched the river flow" suggests a serene and quiet atmosphere, which is inconsistent with the idea of the river "roaring by".
* The verb "flow" implies a gentle movement, whereas "roared" implies a more violent or intense movement, which are mutually exclusive.
* The context does not provide any evidence of the river making a loud noise, whereas "roared" explicitly states that it did.<|eot_id|>
