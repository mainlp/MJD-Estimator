Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* San'doro's words were not hollow, but rather convincing or sincere.
* Jon did not know the truth of San'doro's words immediately, but rather was uncertain or needed more time to think about it.
* San'doro's words were not immediately recognizable as hollow, but rather seemed plausible or believable at first.
* Jon did not have a clear understanding of San'doro's words, and therefore could not determine if they were hollow or not.
* San'doro's words were not intended to be taken as truth, but rather as a hypothetical or rhetorical statement.<|eot_id|>
