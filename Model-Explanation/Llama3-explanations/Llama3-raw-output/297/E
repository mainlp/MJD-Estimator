You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Three more days went by in dreary inaction. 
Statement: The days passed by slowly. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The use of "dreary" to describe the inaction implies a sense of monotony and lack of excitement, which is consistent with the idea that the days passed by slowly.
* The phrase "went by" suggests a sense of time passing, and the adjective "dreary" adds a negative connotation, implying that the time passed slowly.
* The context implies a lack of activity or progress, which can contribute to the feeling that time is moving slowly.
* The use of "three more days" suggests a sense of duration, and the fact that they were marked by "inaction" implies that they felt long or slow.
* The tone of the context is melancholic and uneventful, which is consistent with the idea that the days passed by slowly.<|eot_id|>
