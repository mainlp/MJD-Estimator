* The speaker explicitly states "almost one day" which implies it took less than a day.
* The speaker mentions painting "the whole inside" and "one wall" which suggests a smaller scope of work that can be completed in under a day.
* The speaker's tone and language ("I'm trying to think", "I think") convey a sense of uncertainty and casualness, which contradicts the idea of a time-consuming task that would take over a day.
* The comparison to "newer houses" and the mention of "everything is white" implies a simpler and more efficient process, which would not require more than a day.<|eot_id|>
