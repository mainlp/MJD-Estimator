Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only provides a vague assurance of finding something "all right", but the statement claims it will be "more than adequate", which is a stronger sentiment, making it unclear if the two statements are equivalent.
* The context does not provide enough information about what "it" refers to, making it difficult to determine if the statement is entailed, contradicted, or neutral.
* The tone of the context is casual and reassuring, while the statement is more formal and confident, which may indicate a difference in sentiment or tone that cannot be resolved without more context.
* The context does not provide a clear standard for what "all right" means, making it difficult to determine if "more than adequate" is a stronger or weaker claim.
* The statement uses the phrase "I'm sure", which adds a level of certainty that is not present in the context, making it unclear if the statement is truly entailed or not.<|eot_id|>
