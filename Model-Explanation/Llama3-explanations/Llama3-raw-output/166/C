* The speaker is praising the effort of keeping everyone informed, implying they think it's a good thing.
* The speaker wonders if it's almost more than needed, suggesting they don't think it's too much.
* There is no indication the speaker is the one who shared the information in the first place.
* The speaker's tone is appreciative, not regretful or concerned about sharing too much.
* The context is about someone else's (they've) effort, not the speaker's own actions.<|eot_id|>
