You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In the short term, U.S. consumers will benefit from cheap imports (as will U.S. multinationals that use parts made in East Asian factories). 
Statement: U.S. consumers and factories in East Asia benefit from imports.

* The statement implies that East Asian factories benefit from imports, but the context suggests they are the ones exporting (producing parts).
* The context only mentions U.S. multinationals that use parts made in East Asian factories benefiting, not the factories themselves.
* The statement does not specify "cheap imports" which is a crucial detail in the context.
* The context implies a short-term benefit, but the statement does not provide a time frame.
* The statement is too broad, implying that all East Asian factories benefit, whereas the context only mentions those that supply parts to U.S. multinationals.<|eot_id|>
