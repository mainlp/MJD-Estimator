* The context mentions "as if their feelings had been hurt", which suggests the students were upset or offended, but not horrified.
* The tone of the context is more suggestive of annoyance or indignation, rather than horror.
* Horror typically implies a strong fear or shock response, which is not explicitly mentioned in the context.
