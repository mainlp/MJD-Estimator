* The context only mentions the reaction was swift and contentious, but does not provide enough information to determine the specific emotion (horror) expressed by the students.
* The phrase "as if their feelings had been hurt" suggests the students may have been upset or offended, but it does not necessarily imply horror.
* The context describes the reaction as "contentious", which could imply anger or disagreement, rather than horror.
* The word "horror" is a strong emotion that may not be directly implied by the context, which only describes the reaction as "swift and contentious".
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the intensity or nature of the students' emotions, making it impossible to determine if they reacted with horror.
* The phrase "as if their feelings had been hurt" could suggest a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, or frustration, but not necessarily horror.<|eot_id|>
