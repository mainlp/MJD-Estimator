Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The statement is a paraphrased version of the context, but with added information ("who could finally say it to the public") that is not present in the original context.
* The added information does not contradict the context, but it also does not follow logically from the context.
* The context only mentions that Deborah Pryce said something, but it does not provide any information about her emotional state or her ability to say something to the public.
* The statement implies that Deborah Pryce was previously unable to say something to the public, but this is not supported by the context.
* The context focuses on the grant and the recipient, while the statement focuses on Deborah Pryce's ability to make a statement, making it a different topic.
* The statement can be seen as providing additional information about Deborah Pryce's situation, but this information is not necessarily entailed or contradicted by the context.<|eot_id|>
