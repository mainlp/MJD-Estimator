* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, but it doesn't add new information, so it's undetermined.
* The context mentions "supplies scarce" which is similar to "supplies remained very low", but it's not clear if "hard to maintain" is implied or not.
* The context focuses on the consequences of the scarce supplies (abandoning the fort), while the statement focuses on the supplies themselves, making it unclear if they are equivalent.
* The statement uses more intense language ("very low and hard to maintain") than the context ("scarce"), which might imply a stronger claim, but it's not clear if it's justified.
* The context is about a specific point in time (1858), while the statement is more general, making it unclear if they are referring to the same time period.
* The statement could be seen as a clarification or elaboration of the context, but it's not clear if it's a necessary or obvious inference.<|eot_id|>
