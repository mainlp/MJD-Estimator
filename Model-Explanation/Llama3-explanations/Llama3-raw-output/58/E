* The context explicitly states that a martini should have gin and vermouth, implying that their presence is necessary.
* The use of "should" in the context implies a recommendation or a standard, which in this case, is a requirement for a martini to be composed of gin and vermouth.
* The phrase "a martini" in the statement refers to a traditional or standard martini, which according to the context, must have gin and vermouth.
* The context does not mention any alternative ingredients or variations, suggesting that gin and vermouth are essential components of a martini.
* The statement rephrases the context in a more assertive tone, using "must" instead of "should", which reinforces the idea that gin and vermouth are required ingredients.<|eot_id|>
