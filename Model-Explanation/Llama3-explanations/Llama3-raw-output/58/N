* The statement does not mention a twist, which is a required component according to the context.
* The context uses "should" implying a recommendation or guideline, whereas the statement uses "must" implying a stricter requirement.
* The context does not explicitly state that the presence of gin and vermouth is a necessary condition for a martini, only that it should be composed of those ingredients.
* The statement's wording "composed by" might imply a different relationship between the ingredients than the context's "be".
* The context does not provide enough information to determine if the presence of gin and vermouth is sufficient to define a martini.<|eot_id|>
