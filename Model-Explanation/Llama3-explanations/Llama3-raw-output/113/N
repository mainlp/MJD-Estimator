Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context mentions "every time I've tried to go" but doesn't explicitly state that the speaker can't bowl, leaving room for interpretation.
* The phrase "it's always there's there's always a league bowling" is ambiguous and could be referring to the presence of leagues, but not necessarily implying that the speaker can't bowl.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine if the speaker is able to bowl or not, as it only mentions the presence of leagues.
* The statement assumes a causal relationship between the presence of leagues and the speaker's inability to bowl, which is not explicitly supported by the context.
* The context uses filler words ("yeah", "well", "uh", "I mean") which may indicate hesitation or uncertainty, making it difficult to infer a clear meaning.
* The context doesn't provide enough information about the speaker's intentions or goals, making it unclear if they are able to bowl or not.
* The statement is an inference based on the context, but the context doesn't provide enough evidence to support or refute it.<|eot_id|>
