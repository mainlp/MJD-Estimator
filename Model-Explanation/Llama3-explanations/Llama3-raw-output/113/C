Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The speaker implies that they have tried to go bowling multiple times, but the statement claims that they can't bowl at all, which contradicts the idea of trying.
* The context mentions "every time I've tried to go", which suggests that the speaker has been able to go bowling, but the statement claims that they can't.
* The statement says "there are leagues only", implying that leagues are the only option, but the context mentions "there's always a league bowling", which suggests that leagues are present, but not the only option.
* The context has a casual tone and uses filler words like "uh" and "you know", which suggests that the speaker is not making a strong claim about not being able to bowl, but the statement makes a definitive claim.
* The statement is an exaggeration or an overstatement, as it's unlikely that every time the speaker tries to go bowling, there are only leagues and they can't bowl.<|eot_id|>
