Here are possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The co-op has implemented a policy to discourage coupon accumulation due to the decline in consumer confidence.
* The typical member of the co-op has become so anxious to accumulate coupons that stores have had to ban the practice to prevent hoarding.
* The decline in consumer confidence has led to a surge in coupon collecting, causing stores to run out of stock, and thus, they have banned the practice.
* The co-op has realized that coupon collecting is a sign of anxiety and has decided to prohibit it to promote a more positive shopping experience.
* The increased demand for coupons has driven up prices, making it unprofitable for stores to continue offering them, leading to a ban on coupon collecting.
* The co-op has shifted its focus to other forms of promotions, making coupon collecting obsolete and thus, no longer allowed.<|eot_id|>
