* The context mentions "clearance" which implies a sale, but it doesn't mean all items were on sale, so some non-sale items might have been bought.
* The phrase "we bought this" is ambiguous and could refer to a subset of items, including non-sale ones.
* The context doesn't explicitly state that all items were bought on sale, leaving room for the possibility of non-sale items being purchased.
* The mention of "credit" implies that multiple items were bought, increasing the likelihood of non-sale items being part of the purchase.
* The context's focus on the clearance sale might be distracting from the fact that other, non-sale items were also bought.<|eot_id|>
