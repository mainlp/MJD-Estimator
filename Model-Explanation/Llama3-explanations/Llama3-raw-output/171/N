* The context only mentions buying something on credit, but doesn't specify if it was a sale item or not, so we can't infer that they bought non-sale items.
* The context mentions a clearance, which implies a sale, but it's unclear if they bought only sale items or a mix of sale and non-sale items.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine if all items bought were on credit, or if some were paid in cash.
* The context only mentions finding something on clearance in Memphis, but doesn't specify if that's where they bought it, or if they bought other items elsewhere.
* The context is vague about what "this" refers to, so we can't determine if the statement is true for all items bought or just one specific item.<|eot_id|>
