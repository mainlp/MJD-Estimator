* The quote "you have no instincts" does not mention willpower, so it cannot be inferred that he said that about willpower.
* The context implies that he said something negative about the speaker, but the topic is instincts, not willpower.
* The words "instincts" and "willpower" have different meanings, and there is no logical connection between the two.
* The quote is a direct speech, and it explicitly says "instincts", not "willpower".
* The tone of the context is sad, which suggests that the speaker is being criticized, but the criticism is about lacking instincts, not willpower.<|eot_id|>
