Statement: The book was first drafted in early 1915. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The book was published in 1918, which means the drafting process must have started after 1918, not in 1915.
* The book was published three years after the claimed drafting year, which is a short period for a book to be drafted, reviewed, edited, and published.
* There is no evidence or mention of the book being drafted in 1915 in the context provided.
* The context only provides the publication year, not the drafting year, which implies that the drafting year is unknown or not relevant.
* The statement is making an assumption about the drafting year without providing any supporting evidence or context.<|eot_id|>
