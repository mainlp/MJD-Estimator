Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The book was published in 1918, which implies that it was written before that, and 1915 is a plausible time for the drafting to have occurred.
* The time gap between 1915 and 1918 is sufficient for the drafting, editing, and publishing process to have taken place.
* The author, Mack Lee, may have started writing the book in 1915 and took around three years to complete it.
* The book's content, being a memoir or biography, may have required research and reflection, which could have begun in 1915.
* Mack Lee may have been inspired to write the book in 1915, possibly due to a significant event or anniversary related to the Civil War.<|eot_id|>
