Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The duties are not attached to the goods themselves, but rather are a separate payment made by the importer.
* The duties are not a property or characteristic of the goods, but rather a legal obligation of the importer.
* The goods do not inherently have duties, but rather duties are imposed on them by law.
* The duties are not a feature or attribute of the imported goods, but rather a requirement for their importation.
* The statement implies that the duties are an inherent part of the goods, which is not the case.<|eot_id|>
