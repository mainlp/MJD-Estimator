Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The importer's payment of duties implies the existence of duties to be paid.
* The law requiring duties to be paid suggests that duties are inherently associated with imported goods.
* The act of paying duties is only necessary if duties are applicable to the goods being imported.
* The context assumes a causal relationship between importing goods and the requirement to pay duties, implying that duties are a consequence of importing goods.
* The phrase "required by law" implies that duties are an inherent part of the process of importing goods, and therefore, imported goods have duties.<|eot_id|>
