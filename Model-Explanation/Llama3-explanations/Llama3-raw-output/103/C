Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* "Many" implies a larger number than two, so "over two" is a lower bound that contradicts the context.
* The context implies a plural number, but "over two" could be satisfied with exactly two, which contradicts the implication of "many".
* The context suggests a larger quantity, but "over two" is a relatively small quantity that contradicts the context.
* The word "many" typically implies a number greater than three or four, so "over two" is a lower bound that contradicts the context.<|eot_id|>
