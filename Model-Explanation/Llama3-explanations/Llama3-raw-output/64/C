Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The statement is a paraphrase of the context, so it's actually true, not false.
* The word "steep" is not present in the context, so the statement is not a direct contradiction.
* The context mentions the parts are "difficult to explore", which is similar in meaning to "presents a steep challenge", so the statement is not contradictory.
* There is no information in the context that suggests the rest of the north does not present a challenge, so the statement is not false.
* The context and statement are using different words to convey the same idea, but the meaning is equivalent, so the statement is not false.<|eot_id|>
