You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: And she came to you? 
Statement: The person asked if the woman came to him. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The pronoun "she" in the context refers to the woman mentioned in the statement.
* The phrase "came to you" in the context implies that the woman's action is directed towards the person being referred to, which is the same person mentioned in the statement.
* The context is a question, and the statement is a paraphrased version of that question, making them semantically equivalent.
* The context and the statement share the same meaning and entailment, with the statement being a more explicit and direct formulation of the context.<|eot_id|>
