* The context states that elegant geometric or exuberant, stylized floral patterns are available to all, implying equal accessibility and no price difference.
* The context does not mention any price difference or restriction on purchasing designs once reserved for royalty.
* The availability of designs to all suggests that they are no longer exclusive or limited, which would drive up their cost.
