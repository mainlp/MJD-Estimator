Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The designs were traditionally reserved for royalty, implying they were exclusive and rare, which often correlates with higher cost.
* The fact that they were reserved for royalty suggests they were of high quality or had a high status, which could justify a higher price.
* The contrast between "traditionally" and "today" implies that the designs were previously inaccessible to the general population, which might have driven up their cost.
* The use of "elegant" and "exuberant" to describe the patterns available today implies that the designs once reserved for royalty were of a similar high standard, which could have made them more expensive.
* The fact that the designs are now "available to all" suggests that they may have been previously restricted due to their high cost, which was only accessible to royalty.<|eot_id|>
