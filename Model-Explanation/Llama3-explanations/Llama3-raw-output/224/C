Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context only mentions that centralization was becoming a reality, but it does not explicitly state that Louis XIV cared about it.
* The phrase "dear to Richelieu and Louis XIV" implies that centralization was a goal or ideal of both individuals, but it does not necessarily mean that Louis XIV cared about it in the sense of being emotionally invested.
* The context focuses on the outcome (centralization becoming a reality) rather than Louis XIV's personal feelings or motivations.
* The statement assumes a level of emotional investment or personal interest on the part of Louis XIV, which is not supported by the context.
* The context presents centralization as a policy or goal, rather than a personal preference or emotional concern of Louis XIV.<|eot_id|>
