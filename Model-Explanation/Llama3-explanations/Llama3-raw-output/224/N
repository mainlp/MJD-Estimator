Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context only mentions that centralization was becoming a reality, but it does not explicitly state Louis XIV's feelings or opinions about it.
* The phrase "dear to" in the context implies that Richelieu liked centralization, but it does not provide direct evidence about Louis XIV's views.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the extent to which Louis XIV cared about centralization, only that it was happening during his reign.
* The statement assumes a level of emotional investment ("cared a lot") that is not supported by the context, which only describes a factual situation.
* The context does not rule out the possibility that Louis XIV was indifferent or even opposed to centralization, but was unable to prevent it.<|eot_id|>
