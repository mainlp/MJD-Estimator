* The context only mentions "Maryland woods", but the statement claims "woods north of Boston", which is a different location.
* There is no information in the context that suggests the Maryland woods are north of Boston.
* The context does not provide any geographical information that would allow us to determine the relationship between Maryland and Boston.
* The statement makes a specific claim about the location that is not supported or contradicted by the context.
* The context focuses on the format and tone of the show, but does not provide enough information to determine the exact location.<|eot_id|>
