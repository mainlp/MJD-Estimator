You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It will be held in the Maryland woods, and the telecast will consist of jittery footage of the contestants' slow descent into madness as they are systematically stalked and disappeared/disqualified by Bob Barker. 
Statement: The show will be set in the woods north of Boston.

* The show will be set in the Maryland woods, not the woods north of Boston.
* Maryland and Boston are in different locations, making it impossible for the show to be set in both places.
* The context explicitly states the show will be held in the Maryland woods, contradicting the statement's claim of a different location.<|eot_id|>
