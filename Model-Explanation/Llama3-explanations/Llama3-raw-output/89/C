* The statement says "now", implying a current or ongoing situation, but the context only talks about the past ("it started with..."), suggesting that the effect may not be ongoing.
* The context says "we sexualized violence, we made it beautiful", which implies a negative or problematic connotation, whereas the statement says "look at in the positive", which implies a positive connotation.
* The context does not explicitly state that The Wild Bunch caused violence to be viewed positively, only that it started a trend of sexualizing and beautifying violence, which is not the same thing.
* The statement is too absolute, implying that everyone or society as a whole views violence positively due to The Wild Bunch, whereas the context only suggests a specific trend or influence.
* The context implies a critique or negative commentary on the trend started by The Wild Bunch, whereas the statement presents it as a positive development.<|eot_id|>
