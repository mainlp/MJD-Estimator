* The calculation is based on a cosmological cycle, which is not a precise scientific method.
* The cycle is 1,260 years, which is a rough estimate and not an exact figure.
* Counting back a cycle is an indirect method, prone to errors and inaccuracies.
* The Chinese calendar itself may not be exact, which would affect the calculation.
* The concept of "year of foundation" is often a mythical or legendary event, making it difficult to pinpoint an exact date.
* The calculation is based on a cycle, which implies a repetitive pattern, rather than a unique event with an exact date.<|eot_id|>
