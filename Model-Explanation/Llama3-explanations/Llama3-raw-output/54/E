Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* She was leaning against the bannisters, which implies she needed support to stand.
* Her pale color suggests she might be weak or faint, making it difficult for her to stand.
* The fact that she was found leaning against the bannisters implies she was unable to stand without support.
* The phrase "deadly pale" implies a state of physical distress, which could cause her to lose her balance or strength to stand.
* Leaning against the bannisters is a common action taken when someone feels dizzy or lightheaded, which would make it hard for her to stand on her own.<|eot_id|>
