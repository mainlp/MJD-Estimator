* The context states she was "leaning against the bannisters", implying she was already supported, whereas the statement claims she leaned against the bannisters, implying she did so voluntarily.
* The context describes her as "deadly pale", suggesting she may be in a state of distress or illness, whereas the statement implies she had the ability to make a conscious decision to lean against the bannisters.
* The statement implies she leaned against the bannisters until the narrator found her, but the context does not provide any information about the duration of time she was leaning against the bannisters.
* The context does not mention anything about her inability to stand on her own, whereas the statement makes this claim.<|eot_id|>
