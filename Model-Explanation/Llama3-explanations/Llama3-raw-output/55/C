* The speaker is open to having something to do with "it" because they said "kind of kind of nothing" implying a possibility.
* The speaker has doubts about not wanting to do anything with "it" because the phrase "no doubts about it" is an exaggeration or sarcasm.
* The speaker is being dishonest or hiding their true intentions, and they actually want to have something to do with "it".
* The phrase "kind of kind of nothing" implies a level of interest or curiosity, contradicting the statement "I don't want anything to do with it".
* The tone of the context is casual and uncertain, while the statement is definitive and absolute, indicating a contradiction.
* The speaker is trying to convince themselves or others that they don't want to do anything with "it", but their initial phrase suggests otherwise.<|eot_id|>
