Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context states that other functional components are presumed not to exhibit significant scale economies, implying that not all components operate at a large scale.
* The context does not provide evidence that the Postal Service as a whole only operates very large scale economies.
* The statement is too absolute, using "only" to imply that all components operate at a large scale, which is not supported by the context.
* The context suggests that the scale economies of other functional components are unknown or unproven, so it cannot be concluded that they are all large scale.
* The statement contradicts the context's presumption that other functional components do not exhibit significant scale economies.<|eot_id|>
