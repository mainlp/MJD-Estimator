Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions "this one" without specifying what "one" refers to, making it unclear if it's the same as "this question".
* The context expresses surprise, but the statement doesn't, so it's unclear if the ease of the question is the source of the surprise.
* The context uses "surprisingly easy" which is a subjective evaluation, whereas the statement uses "very easy to answer" which is more objective, making it hard to determine the relationship between the two.
* The context doesn't provide enough information to determine if the ease of the question is the reason for the surprise, or if there's another factor at play.
* The statement could be referring to a different question than the one mentioned in the context.
* The tone of the context is positive (expressing surprise at ease), but the statement is neutral, making it hard to determine the relationship between the two.<|eot_id|>
