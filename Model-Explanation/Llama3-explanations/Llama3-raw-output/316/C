Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions "this one" being easy, but it's unclear if "this one" refers to the question.
* The context uses the phrase "surprisingly easy", implying that the expectation was that it would be difficult, but the statement doesn't convey the same surprise or contrast.
* The context is written in the past tense ("ended up"), while the statement is in the present tense ("was").
* The context doesn't explicitly mention the question, only "this one", which could refer to a different entity or task.
* The tone of the context is more casual and conversational, while the statement is more formal and straightforward.
* The context implies a sense of relief or pleasant surprise, while the statement is more neutral and factual.<|eot_id|>
