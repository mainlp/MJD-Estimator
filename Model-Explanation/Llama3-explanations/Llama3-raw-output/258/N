You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 'You burned down my house.' 
Statement: 'Even though you tried to burn it down, my house is in perfect state.' 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context and statement contradict each other, making it impossible to determine the truth.
* The context implies an action (burning down the house) that is negated by the statement (house is in perfect state).
* The statement uses "even though" which indicates a contrast, but the contrast is not resolvable given the conflicting information.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine the truth of the statement, and the statement itself is not sufficient to resolve the contradiction.
* The statement could be true if the attempt to burn down the house was unsuccessful, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
* The context and statement are based on different assumptions about the state of the house, making it impossible to determine the truth.<|eot_id|>
