* The house is not in perfect state because it was burned down.
* You did burn down the house, contradicting the claim that you only tried to.
* The house cannot be in perfect state if it was burned down, even if the attempt was successful.
* The statement implies that the attempt to burn down the house was unsuccessful, which contradicts the context.
* The context explicitly states that the house was burned down, making it impossible for it to be in perfect state.
* The statement is false because it downplays the severity of the action, from "burned down" to "tried to burn down".
* The house's state is not perfect because burning it down would have caused damage.<|eot_id|>
