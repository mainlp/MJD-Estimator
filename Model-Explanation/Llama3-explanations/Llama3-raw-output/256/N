* The context only provides the name of the speaker, San'doro, but does not provide any information about what they are certain or not certain about.
* The statement "They were certain" is ambiguous, as it does not specify who "they" refers to.
* The context does not provide any information about the topic or issue that "they" are certain about.
* The tone of the context, "Indeed, said San'doro", is neutral and does not provide any emotional or attitudinal cues that could influence the interpretation of the statement.
* The statement "They were certain" could be referring to a past event or a current situation, but the context does not provide any temporal information.
* The context does not provide any information about the speaker's (San'doro's) attitude or opinion about the statement "They were certain".
* The statement "They were certain" could be a statement of fact, an expression of opinion, or a report of someone else's opinion, but the context does not provide any clues about its status.<|eot_id|>
