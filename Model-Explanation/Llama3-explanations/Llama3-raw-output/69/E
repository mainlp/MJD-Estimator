Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context does not mention "recently", so the statement is not supported.
* The context implies that he hadn't seen pictures of such things, which contradicts the statement.
* There is no indication that he had seen pictures of those things in the little art theaters, as the context only mentions silent movies being run, not pictures being shown.<|eot_id|>
