* The context only mentions "since" but doesn't specify when "the few silent movies" were run, so it's unclear if the time gap is recent or not.
* The context doesn't provide a specific time frame for "recently" in the statement, making it difficult to determine if it contradicts the context.
* The context only mentions "some of the little art theaters" without specifying if those are the only places where he saw pictures, leaving open the possibility that he saw pictures elsewhere more recently.
* The context focuses on "silent movies" while the statement mentions "pictures", which could be different forms of media, making it unclear if they are referring to the same thing.
* The context implies a lack of exposure to pictures, but doesn't explicitly state that he hasn't seen any pictures, leaving room for the possibility that he has seen some recently.<|eot_id|>
