Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The statement implies he had seen pictures recently, but the context states he hadn't seen even pictures since the few silent movies, which suggests it was a long time ago.
* The context mentions "since" which indicates a point in the past, whereas the statement implies a recent event.
* The context implies a lack of exposure to pictures of those things, whereas the statement claims he had seen them.
* The time frame mentioned in the context (silent movies in little art theaters) is likely in the past, whereas the statement implies a recent event.
* The use of "even" in the context emphasizes the rarity or lack of exposure to pictures, which contradicts the statement's claim of recent exposure.<|eot_id|>
