* The context does not explicitly state that a CIO must be an operations specialist.
* The context presents multiple possible roles for a CIO, without prioritizing or requiring one over others.
* The context implies that the choice of CIO role depends on the organization's specific needs, which are not specified.
* The statement is too absolute, whereas the context suggests a more nuanced and context-dependent approach to determining a CIO's role.
* The context does not provide sufficient evidence to support or refute the statement.
* The statement is not a logical consequence of the context, which focuses on the process of determining a CIO's role rather than making a definitive claim about it.<|eot_id|>
