* The context only provides information about the person's confidence level, but not the object of his confidence.
* The context does not specify what "then" refers to, making it unclear what event or situation is causing his confidence.
* The statement is too general and could be true in many different situations, making it difficult to determine its truth value based on the context.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the person's confidence is justified or not.
* The statement could be interpreted as either a description of the person's personality or a reaction to a specific event, and the context does not disambiguate this.
* The context does not provide any contradictory or supporting evidence for the statement, leaving its truth value uncertain.<|eot_id|>
