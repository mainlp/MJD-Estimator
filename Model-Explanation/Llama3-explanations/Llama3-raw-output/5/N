Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context:

* The context assumes that political cleansing did not happen through the impeachment process, but it does not provide information about whether it happened through other means.
* The context implies that Clinton has a burden, but it does not specify what that burden is or whether it is related to political cleansing.
* The context does not provide enough information to determine whether political cleansing occurred or not, it only mentions that it did not happen through the impeachment process.
* The statement contradicts the assumption in the context that political cleansing did not happen, but the context does not provide enough evidence to support or refute the statement.
* The context is focused on the burden that Clinton has, rather than on the occurrence or non-occurrence of political cleansing, making it difficult to determine the truth value of the statement.<|eot_id|>
