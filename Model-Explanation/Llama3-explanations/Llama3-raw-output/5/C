Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context explicitly mentions "the political cleansing that did not happen", implying that there was an attempt or an instance of political cleansing.
* The phrase "that did not happen" suggests that there was an expectation or an attempt at political cleansing, which did not succeed.
* The use of "did not happen" implies that there was a possibility or an attempt at political cleansing, which was not fulfilled.
* The context assumes that political cleansing was a possible or intended outcome of the impeachment process, which did not occur.
* The phrase "leaves Clinton with a great and serious burden" implies that there are consequences or repercussions of the political cleansing, which would not be possible if there was no instance of political cleansing.<|eot_id|>
