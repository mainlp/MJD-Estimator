* The context only mentions that co-requesters cannot restrict the timing, but the statement "They" is ambiguous and may refer to a different entity that is not a co-requester.
* The context only talks about the restrictions after the product is issued, but the statement does not specify when the restriction will happen.
* The statement is in the future tense, but the context is in the present tense, making it unclear if the context's restrictions apply to the statement's scenario.
* The context does not provide enough information about who "They" are, making it impossible to determine if they are allowed to restrict the timing or not.
* The context only mentions that co-requesters cannot restrict the timing, but it does not say that no one can restrict the timing, leaving open the possibility that someone else can.
* The statement is too vague and does not provide enough information to determine if it is true or false based on the context.<|eot_id|>
