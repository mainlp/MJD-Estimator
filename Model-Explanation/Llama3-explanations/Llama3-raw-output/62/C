* Co-requesters cannot restrict the timing of the release of the product.
* The statement implies that co-requesters have the ability to restrict the timing of the release, which is not the case.
* The context explicitly states that co-requesters cannot restrict the timing of the release, making the statement false.
* The statement contradicts the context, which denies co-requesters the power to restrict the timing of the release.
* The context implies that the timing of the release is not under the control of co-requesters, making the statement incorrect.<|eot_id|>
