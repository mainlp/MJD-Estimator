* The statement is false because the context explicitly states that co-requesters cannot restrict the timing of the release of the product.
* There is no information in the context that suggests "they" refers to anyone other than co-requesters, and co-requesters are explicitly prohibited from restricting the timing of the release.
* The context does not provide any exceptions or special cases where co-requesters can restrict the timing of the release.
* The statement is not true because it contradicts the context, which states that co-requesters cannot restrict the timing of the release.<|eot_id|>
