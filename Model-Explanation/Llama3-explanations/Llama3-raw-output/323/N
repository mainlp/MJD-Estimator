* The context only mentions Jon's gladness, but not his sadness, so it's unclear if he was also sad.
* The statement assumes Jon's emotional state is related to her happiness, but the context doesn't provide that information.
* The context focuses on Jon's relief or gladness, while the statement implies Jon's emotional response is about her emotional state, which might not be the case.
* The statement's wording is too specific, and the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny Jon's emotional state in those exact terms.
* The context doesn't provide any information about Jon's expectations or desires regarding her emotional state, making it difficult to infer his emotional response.
* The statement's negation ("she wasn't happy") doesn't necessarily imply Jon's sadness, as he might be glad for other reasons.
* The context's tone is positive (Jon is "glad"), while the statement implies a negative emotion (Jon is "sad"), which might not be compatible.<|eot_id|>
