Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment) given the context:

* The existence of specific crowds implies that some marketers may not be satisfied with catering to just one crowd, hence the need to broaden appeal.
* The need to hunt around to find the right fit suggests that some marketers may think that the current options are too niche, leading to a desire to broaden appeal.
* The fact that each caters to a specific crowd implies that there may be gaps in the market, which some marketers believe can be filled by broadening appeal.
* The emphasis on finding the right fit for an individual implies that some marketers think that the current offerings are not inclusive enough, hence the need to broaden appeal.
* The context implies that there are multiple options, which may lead some marketers to believe that they can be more successful by appealing to a wider audience.<|eot_id|>
