* The context does not provide enough information about the marketers' opinions or the specific crowd being referred to.
* The statement does not explicitly contradict or support the idea of catering to a specific crowd.
* The context focuses on finding the right fit for an individual, while the statement discusses broadening appeal, making it unclear how they relate.
* The statement's tone is ambiguous, and it's unclear whether the marketers are arguing for or against the idea of catering to a specific crowd.
* The context does not provide a clear stance on the importance of broad appeal, making it difficult to determine the relationship between the two.
* The statement could be seen as either supporting the idea of catering to a specific crowd (by implying that broad appeal is not necessary) or arguing against it (by suggesting that more effort is needed to reach a wider audience).
