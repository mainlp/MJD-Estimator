Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is false:

* The context implies that catering to specific crowds is sufficient, so there is no need to broaden appeal.
* The existence of multiple options for different crowds suggests that marketers have already made efforts to cater to various groups, making the argument for more effort unnecessary.
* The phrase "hunt around until you find the one right for you" implies that individuals can find a suitable option among the existing ones, reducing the need for broader appeal.
* The context focuses on the diversity of options, which contradicts the idea that more effort is needed to broaden appeal.<|eot_id|>
