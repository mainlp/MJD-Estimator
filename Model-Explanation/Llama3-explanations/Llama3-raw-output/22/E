Statement: There was a question on Tuesday. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The context mentions Monday's question, implying that there was a question on Monday, and since Monday is followed by Tuesday, it is likely that there was a question on Tuesday as well.
* The phrase "Monday's Question (No." suggests that there is a sequence of questions, and Tuesday would be the next day in the sequence, making it probable that there was a question on Tuesday.
* The context does not explicitly state that there was no question on Tuesday, so it can be inferred that there was a question on Tuesday.
* The mention of Monday's question sets a precedent for questions being asked on weekdays, increasing the likelihood that there was a question on Tuesday.<|eot_id|>
