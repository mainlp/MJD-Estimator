You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Monday's Question (No. 
Statement: There was a question on Tuesday. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is undetermined (neutral):

* The context only mentions Monday's question, but the statement talks about Tuesday, which is out of the context's scope.
* There is no information provided about Tuesday, so it's impossible to infer whether there was a question on Tuesday or not.
* The context does not provide any implications or connections to Tuesday, making it impossible to determine the truth value of the statement.
* The statement is asking about a different day (Tuesday) than the one mentioned in the context (Monday), making it unclear whether the statement is true or false.
* The context does not provide enough information to support or refute the statement, leaving it undetermined.<|eot_id|>
