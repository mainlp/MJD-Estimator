Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* The authority has exceptions, and they were trying to remove all of them.
* The exceptions established in 31 U.S.C. are not absolute, and they were trying to minimize or abolish them.
* The context implies that the authority is generally absolute, and they were trying to make it even more absolute by eliminating exceptions.
* The limited exceptions in 31 U.S.C. are not sufficient, and they were trying to remove all loopholes or special cases.
* The goal was to make the authority more comprehensive and universal, without any exceptions or exemptions.<|eot_id|>
