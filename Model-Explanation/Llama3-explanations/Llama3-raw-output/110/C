* The context explicitly states that "extremely limited exceptions" are established, implying that not all exceptions are eliminated.
* The presence of exceptions in 31 U.S.C. contradicts the idea of eliminating all exceptions.
* If all exceptions were eliminated, there would be no need to establish exceptions in 31 U.S.C.
* The phrase "extremely limited" suggests that some exceptions are allowed, which contradicts the statement that they were trying to eliminate all exceptions.<|eot_id|>
