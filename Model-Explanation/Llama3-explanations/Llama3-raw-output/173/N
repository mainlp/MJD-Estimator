Statement: It has table service. 
Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

* The context only mentions the type of menu options available, but does not provide information about the service style.
* The presence of buffet and a la carte options does not necessarily imply table service, as it is possible to have a buffet or a la carte with counter service or self-service.
* The context does not explicitly state or imply that the establishment has table service, so it cannot be inferred.
* The statement "It has table service" is making a claim about the service style, which is not addressed in the context.
* The context is silent about the service style, so it is impossible to determine whether the statement is true or false.
* There is no logical connection between the type of menu options and the service style, so the statement cannot be inferred from the context.<|eot_id|>
