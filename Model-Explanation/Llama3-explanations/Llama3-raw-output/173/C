* "Buffet" implies a self-service style where customers serve themselves, contradicting the idea of table service.
* "A la carte" typically involves ordering individual dishes, which may not necessarily involve table service.
* The presence of a buffet and a la carte options suggests a more casual, flexible dining arrangement, which is less likely to have traditional table service.
* Table service typically implies a more formal, sit-down dining experience, which is not suggested by the context.<|eot_id|>
