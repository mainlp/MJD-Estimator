* The statement implies that many kings founded orders that still exist, but the context only provides a single example of James VII founding an order that continues today.
* The context does not provide evidence that kings frequently founded orders, only that one king (James VII) did so.
* The statement is too general, implying a common practice among kings, whereas the context only provides a specific instance.
* The context does not support the idea that founding orders that still exist today was a frequent activity among kings.<|eot_id|>
