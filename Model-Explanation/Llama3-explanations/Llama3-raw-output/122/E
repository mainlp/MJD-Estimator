Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true (entailment):

* James VII, a king, founded an order that continues today.
* The order founded by James VII still exists today, implying that kings (like James VII) have founded orders that can still be found today.
* The existence of an order founded by a king (James VII) that continues today is evidence that kings frequently founded orders that can still be found today.
* The fact that James VII, a king, founded an order that still exists today suggests that it is common for kings to found orders that can still be found today.
* The order's continued existence today implies that its founder, a king (James VII), is an example of a king who founded an order that can still be found today, supporting the claim that kings frequently do so.<|eot_id|>
