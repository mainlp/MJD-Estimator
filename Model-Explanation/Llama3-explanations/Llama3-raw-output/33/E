Answer:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Here are the possible explanations why the statement is true:

* The context mentions that users pick obvious, easily cracked passwords, implying that they do not prioritize security.
* The context also mentions that system administrators ignore basic security precautions, implying that they do not prioritize security either.
* The criticism of both users and system administrators in the context suggests that they share a common fault, which is not prioritizing security.
* The fact that news berates both users and system administrators implies that they are both guilty of the same mistake, which is not prioritizing security.
* The context presents a contrast between what is expected of users and system administrators (i.e., prioritizing security) and what they actually do (i.e., not prioritizing security), highlighting their shared failure.<|eot_id|>
