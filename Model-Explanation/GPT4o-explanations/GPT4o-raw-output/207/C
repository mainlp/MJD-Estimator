- The context suggests that proof of identity is not necessarily a minimum requirement, as it is presented as one of several possible options.
- The context implies that there might be alternatives to proving identity, such as providing a password, which contradicts the statement that identity should be a minimum requirement.
- The use of "perhaps" and "at any rate" in the context indicates uncertainty or flexibility in requirements, contradicting the assertion that identity should be a minimum requirement.
- The context allows for the possibility that identity proof might not be required at all, which directly contradicts the statement.
