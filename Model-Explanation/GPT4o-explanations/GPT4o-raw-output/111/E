2. The site of the ancient capital might have been mistakenly identified or mythologized as the site of an asteroid impact over time.
3. Historical records or local legends might have conflated the ancient capital with an asteroid impact site due to similar naming or geographical proximity.
4. The rocky outcropping itself might have been formed or significantly altered by an ancient asteroid impact, leading to the dual naming.
5. Archaeological or geological evidence at the site might suggest an asteroid impact, leading to its identification as such.
