1. The context does not provide information about the material or condition of the tip, leaving its fragility uncertain.
2. The context focuses on the shape and purpose of the tip, not its durability or effectiveness.
3. The context describes a design feature related to function, not the physical properties like strength or sharpness.
4. The statement introduces a new attribute (fragility) not addressed in the context.
5. The context implies a functional design for a specific use, but does not confirm the tip's ability to scratch or its robustness.
6. The context's focus on the tip's shape does not inherently suggest anything about its structural integrity or performance.
7. The context does not mention any testing or usage outcomes that would confirm or deny the statement's claim about fragility.
