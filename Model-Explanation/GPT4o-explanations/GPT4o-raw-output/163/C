- Marginal costs are low, suggesting that production costs are minimal, making a $5 price unlikely.
- A price of 5 or 6 cents per piece is explicitly mentioned, indicating that $5 is significantly higher than the expected range.
- The context implies affordability and low pricing, contradicting the high cost of $5.
- The term "as low as" suggests a price ceiling much lower than $5.
- The economic principle of low marginal costs typically leads to lower consumer prices, not higher ones like $5.
