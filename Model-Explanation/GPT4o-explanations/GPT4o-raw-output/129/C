- The low prices are a result of low marginal costs, which means they are economically justified.
- New printers benefit from low prices as they reduce the barrier to entry in the market.
- The prices are set based on production costs, not on fairness to printers.
- The market determines prices, and low prices can increase demand, benefiting all printers.
- Fairness is subjective, and the prices reflect competitive market conditions rather than unfairness.
- New printers can still profit due to the low cost of production, despite the low selling price.
- The pricing strategy is aimed at maximizing circulation and accessibility, not disadvantaging new printers.
