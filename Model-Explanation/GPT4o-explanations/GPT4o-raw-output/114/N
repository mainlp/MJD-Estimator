- The context does not specify whether the maharaja explicitly allowed or disallowed the construction of houseboats.
- The British might have built the houseboats without seeking or receiving explicit permission from the maharaja.
- The maharaja's prohibition was specifically about buying land, not about building houseboats, leaving the latter ambiguous.
- The context implies a workaround by the British, but it does not clarify if this was officially sanctioned by the maharaja.
- The maharaja's stance on houseboats is not mentioned, so it is unclear if he was aware of or indifferent to their construction.
- The statement could imply permission, but the context only describes the British's actions without detailing the maharaja's response.
