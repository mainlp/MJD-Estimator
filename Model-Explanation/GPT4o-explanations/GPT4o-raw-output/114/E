- The maharaja's prohibition was specifically against buying land, not against building houseboats.
- Building houseboats did not require land ownership, thus circumventing the maharaja's restriction.
- The maharaja's rules did not extend to the waters of the lakes, allowing for construction on them.
- The British found a loophole in the maharaja's decree by using the lakes for their houseboats.
- The maharaja may have implicitly permitted the construction of houseboats by not enforcing restrictions on the lakes.
- The maharaja's focus was on preventing land ownership, not on controlling activities on the water.
- The construction of houseboats was seen as a non-intrusive alternative that did not violate the maharaja's land ownership ban.
