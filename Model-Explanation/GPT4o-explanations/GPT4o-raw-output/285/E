- Planting in colder weather may prevent plants from being exposed to pests and diseases that thrive in warmer conditions.
- Colder temperatures might help certain plants establish stronger root systems before the growing season.
- Some plants may require a period of cold stratification to germinate effectively.
- Planting in colder weather could reduce the need for frequent watering, as evaporation rates are lower.
- Colder conditions might slow down the growth process, allowing for more controlled development of the plants.
- Early planting in colder weather can lead to earlier harvests once the weather warms up.
- Certain plants may be more resilient to cold and can take advantage of the early start to outcompete weeds.
