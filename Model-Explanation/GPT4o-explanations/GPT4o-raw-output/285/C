- Plants typically require warmer temperatures to germinate and grow effectively.
- Colder temperatures can lead to frost, which may damage or kill young plants.
- Soil is often harder and less workable in colder conditions, making planting more difficult.
- Many plants have specific temperature requirements for optimal growth, which are usually met in warmer conditions.
- Colder weather can slow down the biological processes necessary for plant development.
- Warmer temperatures generally provide more sunlight, which is essential for photosynthesis.
- In colder climates, the growing season is shorter, reducing the time plants have to mature.
- Warmer conditions can enhance soil microbial activity, benefiting plant health and growth.
