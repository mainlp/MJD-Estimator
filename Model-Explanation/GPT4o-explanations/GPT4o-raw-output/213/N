4. The context does not provide information on whether FGD systems are designed to perform similar tasks as SCR systems.
5. The context focuses on construction proximity, which is unrelated to the concept of replication.
6. The statement could imply replication in terms of technology or process, which is not addressed in the context.
7. The context does not clarify if there is any intentional or unintentional replication between the two systems.
