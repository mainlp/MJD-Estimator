1. FGD systems and SCR systems may share similar design principles or components, leading to a perception of replication.
2. Both systems might be used in similar industrial applications, causing them to be seen as replicating each other in function.
3. The construction and operational processes of FGD systems might mimic those of SCR systems to achieve similar environmental compliance goals.
4. The technological advancements in SCR systems could influence the design and implementation of FGD systems, resulting in perceived replication.
5. Industry standards or regulations might drive both systems to adopt similar features or configurations, leading to a sense of replication.
6. The integration of FGD systems with existing SCR systems could create a scenario where FGD systems appear to replicate the structure or function of SCR systems.
7. Market trends or competitive pressures might push manufacturers to design FGD systems that closely resemble SCR systems in order to appeal to the same customer base.
