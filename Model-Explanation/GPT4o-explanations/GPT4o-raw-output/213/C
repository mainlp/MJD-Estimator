- FGD systems are typically constructed closer to the ground, whereas SCR systems are not, indicating a difference in their structural design and placement.
- The purpose and function of FGD systems differ from those of SCR systems, as FGD systems are primarily used for removing sulfur dioxide, while SCR systems are used for reducing nitrogen oxides.
- The construction and operational processes of FGD systems do not mimic those of SCR systems, as they involve different technologies and mechanisms.
- The spatial and engineering requirements for FGD systems are distinct from those of SCR systems, leading to different design and installation approaches.
- FGD systems and SCR systems address different environmental concerns, which results in differing system designs and implementations.
