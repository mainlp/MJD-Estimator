1. The context does not specify the location of Castlerigg, so it is unclear if it is in Scotland.
2. The context does not provide information about other examples, so it is uncertain if Castlerigg is considered a "good" example in addition to being the "best."
3. The context does not mention any criteria for what makes an example "good," leaving it open to interpretation.
4. The context does not confirm or deny the existence of Castlerigg in Scotland, making the statement's geographical claim uncertain.
