1. The context does not specify the humidity level, so the air could be either humid or arid.
2. Warm air can be either arid or humid, so the statement about arid air is not directly supported or contradicted.
3. The context does not provide information about the surrounding land, so it is unclear if the air permeates it.
4. The context only mentions temperature, not the air's effect on the environment.
5. The statement introduces new information about the air's aridity and its interaction with the land, which is not addressed in the context.
