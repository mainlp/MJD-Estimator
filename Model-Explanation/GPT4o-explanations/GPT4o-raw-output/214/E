- The I-695 victory was due to factors unrelated to its campaign to help the people, such as a bad tax and a botched opposition campaign.
- The $1 billion reserve and voters calling a bluff suggest that the campaign's promises were not convincing or beneficial to the people.
- The context implies that the victory was more about the circumstances than the campaign's effectiveness in helping the people.
- The campaign may have been perceived as insincere or ineffective, leading to its failure in genuinely helping the people despite the victory.
