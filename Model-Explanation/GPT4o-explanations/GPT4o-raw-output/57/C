- The system's rules clearly state that a sentence of life and a day makes someone ineligible for parole, which is a straightforward application of the law rather than corruption.
- The distinction between "life" and "life and a day" is a legal framework designed to differentiate between parole eligibility, not an indication of corruption.
- The context suggests that the system is functioning as intended by enforcing the rules as they are written, rather than being corrupt.
- The statement implies wrongdoing or unfairness, but the context indicates that the parole eligibility criteria are transparent and consistent with the legal guidelines.
