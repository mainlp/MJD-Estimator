- The definitive test is conducted over a longer period, which can affect the observed toxicity levels.
- The sample used in the follow-up test may be collected at a different time, leading to variations in toxicity.
- The level of toxicity in the sample can significantly differ between the range-finding test and the follow-up test due to changes in sample conditions or composition.
