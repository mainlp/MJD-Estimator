- The duration of the definitive test is longer, which can affect the observed toxicity levels.
- The sample used in the follow-up test may be collected at a different time, leading to variations in toxicity.
- Environmental or experimental conditions may differ between the range-finding and follow-up tests, impacting toxicity results.
- The chemical composition or concentration of the sample might change over time, affecting toxicity.
- Variability in measurement techniques or equipment between tests could lead to different toxicity readings.
- Biological factors, such as organism adaptation or resistance, might influence toxicity outcomes differently in each test.
