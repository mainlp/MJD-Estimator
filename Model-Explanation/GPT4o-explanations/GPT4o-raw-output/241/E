1. The conditions under which both tests are conducted are identical, including the sample collection time and environmental factors.
2. The sample used in both tests is from the same batch, ensuring consistent toxicity levels.
3. There is no significant degradation or change in the sample's composition over time.
4. The range-finding test and the follow-up test are conducted simultaneously, eliminating time-related variability.
5. The sample's toxicity is stable and unaffected by external variables or test duration.
6. Both tests are conducted using the same methodology and equipment, ensuring consistent results.
7. The sample's inherent properties result in a consistent toxicity level regardless of test conditions.
