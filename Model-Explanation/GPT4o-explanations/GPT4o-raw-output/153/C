- The statement is false because the context specifies that only estuaries and wetlands are impaired by mercury emissions, not rivers, streams, and lakes.
- The context indicates that mercury emissions affect only a specific number of miles of streams, rivers, and coasts, suggesting that not all such bodies of water are impacted, contradicting the statement's implication of a broader impact.
- The statement implies a general impact on rivers, streams, and lakes, whereas the context provides specific figures that may not support a widespread impact.
- The context might imply that the impairment is due to factors other than mercury emissions, contradicting the statement's attribution of impact solely to mercury.
