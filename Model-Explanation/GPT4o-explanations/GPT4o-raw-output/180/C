- Not every pack contains high-value or rare cards.
- Packs are designed to have a mix of common and rare cards, not exclusively rare ones.
- The presence of only a few high-value cards implies scarcity, not abundance.
- The comparison to lottery tickets suggests that obtaining rare cards is based on chance, not certainty.
- The manufacturer's strategy relies on the rarity of high-value cards to drive sales.
