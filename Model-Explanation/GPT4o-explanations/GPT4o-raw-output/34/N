1. The context does not specify what kind of license the writer took, so it is unclear if it relates to being factual and careful.
2. The context does not explicitly mention the need for factuality or carefulness, only that certain licenses are no longer allowed.
3. The statement could imply a change in standards, but the context does not confirm whether factuality and carefulness are the reasons for the change.
4. The context might refer to creative or stylistic license rather than factual accuracy.
5. The context does not provide information on the current expectations or requirements for newspaper writers.
6. The statement assumes a causal relationship between the restriction of license and the need for factuality, which is not explicitly supported by the context.
7. The context does not indicate whether the change in license affects all aspects of writing, including factuality and carefulness.
