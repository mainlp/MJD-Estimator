- The context acknowledges that even well-designed studies have uncertainty, but it specifies that the amount of uncertainty varies based on the quality of the study.
- The context implies that well-designed studies have narrower uncertainty bounds, suggesting variability in uncertainty levels across studies.
- The statement contradicts the context by asserting uniformity in uncertainty, which is not supported by the context's emphasis on differences in study quality.
- The context does not explicitly state that all studies have the same amount of uncertainty, leaving room for variability.
- The context highlights a comparison between well-designed and lesser-quality studies, indicating that uncertainty is not uniform across all studies.
