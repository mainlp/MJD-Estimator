1. The context mentions the cost is "almost prohibitive," which suggests it is very high, but not definitively prohibitive, leaving room for interpretation.
2. The statement implies that the cost makes it hard to bring it to a dealer, but "almost prohibitive" does not necessarily mean it is actually hard, just potentially challenging.
3. The context does not specify what "it" refers to, so the statement's reference to "fixing it" is ambiguous.
4. The context might imply other factors besides cost that could influence the decision to bring it to a dealer, which the statement does not address.
5. The context does not confirm whether the speaker ultimately decides to bring it to a dealer or not, leaving the outcome open-ended.
6. The statement assumes a direct causal relationship between cost and difficulty, which the context does not explicitly establish.
7. The context might suggest that despite the high cost, there could be other compelling reasons to bring it to a dealer, which the statement does not consider.
