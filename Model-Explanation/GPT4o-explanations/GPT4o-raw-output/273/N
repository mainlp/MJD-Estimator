- The statement could be true if the capacity factor is significantly higher than 85 percent, leading to increased AC usage.
- Variations in the efficiency of mercury control technology across different plants could result in higher AC usage.
- Differences in the operational practices or maintenance schedules of power plants might lead to increased AC usage.
- The assumptions in Tables 4-4 and 4-5 might not hold true in practice, affecting the proportionality.
- There could be additional factors or technologies not accounted for that influence AC usage.
- The statement might be based on a specific time period or set of conditions not reflected in the context.
- Measurement errors or discrepancies in data collection could lead to perceived higher AC usage.
- Regional or plant-specific regulations might require more stringent mercury control, increasing AC usage.
- The context assumes average conditions, but actual conditions might vary significantly, affecting usage.
