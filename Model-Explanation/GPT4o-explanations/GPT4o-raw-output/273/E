- The average capacity factor of 85 percent is not being met, leading to higher AC usage.
- The assumptions in Tables 4-4 and 4-5 are not accurate or are being violated, resulting in increased AC usage.
- There is an overestimation of the mercury control requirements, causing higher AC usage.
- The technology used for mercury control is less efficient than expected, leading to increased AC usage.
- There are additional factors or inefficiencies in the mercury control process that are not accounted for, resulting in higher AC usage.
- The coal-fired facilities are operating at a lower efficiency than anticipated, requiring more AC for mercury control.
- There is a miscalculation or error in the proportionality assumption between AC usage and total MWe.
- The coal-fired facilities are using more AC than necessary due to operational practices or policies.
- There is an increase in mercury emissions that necessitates higher AC usage for control.
- The technology for mercury control is being used more extensively or aggressively than planned, leading to higher AC usage.
