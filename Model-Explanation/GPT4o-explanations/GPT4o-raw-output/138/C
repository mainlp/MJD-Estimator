- Communists were perceived as adversaries, not allies, during the Cold War.
- The prevalent belief was that Communists aimed to undermine, not assist, the U.S. government.
- The suspicion was that Communists were infiltrating to harm, not help, American democracy.
- The context suggests a climate of distrust and fear towards Communists, not cooperation.
- Assistance implies a positive contribution, which contradicts the notion of subversion.
