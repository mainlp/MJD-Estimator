- DSM-III-R is not exclusively a book of personality disorders; it covers a wide range of mental disorders.
- Masochistic Personality Disorder was suggested but did not make it into DSM-III-R, indicating that not all proposed personality disorders were included.
- The context implies that DSM-III-R is a revised edition of DSM-III, which is a comprehensive manual for mental disorders, not limited to personality disorders.
