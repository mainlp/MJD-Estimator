1. The term "highly magnified" refers to visual enlargement, while "amplified" could imply enhancement in a different sense, such as sound or intensity, leading to ambiguity.
2. "Plain for you to see" suggests obviousness, but the context does not confirm whether the amplification is visually apparent or pertains to another attribute.
3. The context does not specify what "it" refers to, leaving room for interpretation about what is being magnified or amplified.
4. The context does not clarify whether the magnification process involves amplification, making it unclear if they are synonymous in this scenario.
5. The statement implies a subjective perception ("plain for you to see"), which may not align with the objective description in the context.
6. The context lacks information on the purpose or method of magnification, which could influence whether amplification is an accurate description.
7. The context does not provide details on the observer's perspective or tools used, which could affect the interpretation of magnification versus amplification.
