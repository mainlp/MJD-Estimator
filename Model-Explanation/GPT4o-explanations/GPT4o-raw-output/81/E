1. "Eliminate" is interpreted as "finalize" or "complete," meaning the standard technology assumptions were essential in finalizing the projections.
2. The standard technology assumptions were a critical component in the process of developing and thus completing the AEO2001 reference case projections.
3. The use of standard technology assumptions was a necessary step in the methodology that led to the completion of the AEO2001 reference case projections.
4. The process of developing the AEO2001 reference case projections involved refining and finalizing projections, which was achieved using the standard technology assumptions.
5. The standard technology assumptions provided a framework or baseline that was integral to the completion of the AEO2001 reference case projections.
