1. The context implies that only a hard copy is available, suggesting that an email is not an option, which aligns with the statement rather than contradicts it.
2. The statement "An email won't cut it" is consistent with the context, as both indicate that a hard copy is necessary, not contradicting the context.
3. The context does not provide any information that would suggest an email is sufficient, so there is no contradiction with the statement.
4. The context and statement both imply the inadequacy of an email, so they do not contradict each other.
