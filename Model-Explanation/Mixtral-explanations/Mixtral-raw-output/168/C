Statement: There's no point in following politics or voting because your vote won't actually make a difference. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context and statement address unrelated topics.
2. The statement is about the impact of voting, while the context is about rulemaking and public comments.
3. The context mentions a situation where public input is sought and considered, which is different from the statement's claim that individual votes don't matter.
4. The statement implies that engaging in the political process is pointless, while the context highlights the value of participation in rulemaking.</s>
