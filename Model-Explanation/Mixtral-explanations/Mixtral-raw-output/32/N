<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It's thought he used the same architect who worked on the Taj Mahal. 
Statement: In reality, he did not use the Taj Mahal's architect. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't deny that the same architect who worked on the Taj Mahal was consulted for the project, but merely asserts that he wasn't the one who "used" him.
2. The context refers to the architect who "worked on" the Taj Mahal, while the statement denies that he was the one who "did not use the Taj Mahal's architect," which could mean that someone else in the project used a different architect.
3. The context might be referring to a different project or time period than what the statement is addressing.
4. The statement doesn't specify whether the individual in question was directly involved in "using" the architect, leaving room for ambiguity.
5. The context might be using "used" in a metaphorical or figurative sense, while the statement takes it literally.
6. The context and statement might be using different definitions of "the same architect," with the context referring to someone with similar skills or style, and the statement denying the involvement of the exact same person.</s>
