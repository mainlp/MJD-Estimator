<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In manual systems, attestations, verifications, and approvals are usually shown by a signature or initial of an individual on a hard copy document. 
Statement: The only things that signatures in manual systems show are attestations, verifications, or approvals. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Implicit assumptions: The statement assumes that signatures in manual systems have no other purpose than showing attestations, verifications, or approvals. However, there might be other uses of signatures that are not mentioned in the context.
2. Ambiguity in the context: The context does not explicitly state that attestations, verifications, and approvals are the only purposes of signatures in manual systems. It only mentions these three uses, leaving open the possibility of other functions.
3. Lack of information about digital systems: The context focuses on manual systems, and there is no information provided about digital systems. In digital systems, signatures might have different uses, making the statement not universally applicable.
4. Potential cultural differences: The context and statement do not account for cultural differences in using signatures. In some cultures, signatures might have additional meanings or uses, making the statement not universally valid.
5. Absence of information about special cases: The context does not mention any special cases where signatures might have different purposes, such as legal or historical documents. The absence of this information makes it difficult to determine the validity of the statement in all cases.</s>
