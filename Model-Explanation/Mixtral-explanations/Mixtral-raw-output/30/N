<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit 
Statement: Cubans would go up in arms if we tried to annex Cuba. 
Answer: [/INST] * The context only states that Cubans wouldn't like annexation, but it doesn't specify the level of discontent or the actions they would take.
* Going "up in arms" could mean a range of reactions, from vocal protests to armed resistance, and the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact response.
* The context might imply that Cubans would express their disapproval, but it does not necessarily mean they would take up arms.
* The statement might be an overinterpretation of the context, assuming a more extreme reaction than what the context actually suggests.
* The context and the statement might be consistent with each other, but they do not necessarily imply a causal relationship or a direct quote, so the exact meaning remains ambiguous.
* The statement might be an exaggeration or a hyperbole, using strong language to convey a general sentiment, rather than a literal prediction of events.
* The context and the statement might be using different frames of reference, one focusing on the possibility of annexation and the other on the potential reaction, without specifying the exact relationship between them.
* The context and the statement might be using different time frames, one referring to the present and the other
