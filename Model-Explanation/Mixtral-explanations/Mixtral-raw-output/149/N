Statement: SSA wants the authority to recover overpayments made to insurers. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not specify the type of overpayments SSA wants to recover.
2. It's unclear if "additional tools" mentioned in the context refer to recovering overpayments made to insurers.
3. The context may refer to overpayments made to beneficiaries, not insurers.
4. The statement assumes that SSA does not already have the authority to recover overpayments made to insurers.
5. The context may have been talking about overpayments in general, not specifically overpayments made to insurers.
6. The statement is not directly contradicted by the context, but it is not explicitly supported either.
7. The context may refer to overpayments made through a different program or system.
8. The statement is too specific, as the context does not mention any specific type of overpayment.
9. The context may refer to overpayments made in the future, not overpayments that have already been made.
10. The statement assumes that "insurers" are the only possible entities that could receive overpayments from SSA.</s>
