<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: SSA is also seeking statutory authority for additional tools to recover current overpayments. 
Statement: SSA wants the authority to recover overpayments made to insurers. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. "Insurers" are a type of entity that can receive overpayments from SSA.
2. SSA's recovery efforts only apply to overpayments, not underpayments or other types of financial transactions.
3. The authority SSA seeks is for "additional tools" beyond what they currently have, implying they already have some authority to recover overpayments.
4. The overpayments in question are current, meaning they have already been made and SSA has not yet recovered them.
5. The authority SSA seeks is for recovering overpayments, not for preventing them from being made in the first place.
6. The overpayments are not specified to be from a particular program or group within SSA, indicating it could be from any program or group.
7. The recovery of overpayments is a priority for SSA, as they are actively seeking statutory authority to do so.</s>
