<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: well we bought this with credit too  well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh 
Statement: We bought non-sale items in Memphis on credit. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not specify whether the item purchased on credit is the same as the one found on clearance.
2. The context does not clarify if any non-sale items were bought in Memphis on credit.
3. The statement could be true if the item found on clearance was also bought on credit, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
4. The statement could be false if only sale items were bought on credit, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this either.
5. The context does not indicate whether the purchase on credit occurred in Memphis or not.
6. The statement assumes that the purchase was made in Memphis, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
7. The statement assumes that the items bought on credit were not on sale, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
8. The context does not specify the time of the purchase, so it is unclear if it aligns with the statement or not.</s>
