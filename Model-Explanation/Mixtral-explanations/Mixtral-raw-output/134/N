<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It has served as a fortress for the Gallo-Romans, the Visigoths, Franks, and medieval French (you can see the layers of their masonry in the ramparts). 
Statement: The fortress was built by the medieval French in 1173. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could be referring to a different fortress than the one mentioned in the context.
2. The word "built" could be interpreted as "rebuilt" or "added to," rather than constructing the entire structure.
3. The medieval French could have made significant renovations or expansions to the fortress in 1173, but not necessarily built it from the ground up.
4. The context only mentions that the medieval French were among the groups that used the fortress, not necessarily that they built it.
5. The statement does not specify whether the medieval French built the entire fortress or just a part of it.
6. The context provides no information about the construction date of the fortress, making it possible that it was built before 1173 by a different group.
7. The statement does not specify whether the fortress was in continuous use from the time of the Gallo-Romans to the medieval French, or if there were periods of disuse or use by other groups in between.</s>
