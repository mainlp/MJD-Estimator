<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Ca'daan heard the Kal grunt and felt the horse lift. 
Statement: The Kal heard Ca'daan grunt. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Ca'daan, not the Kal, was the one who made the grunting sound.
2. The Kal is not capable of hearing, only responding physically to stimuli.
3. The sound made by the Kal was not a grunt, but another type of noise.
4. The horse's movement of lifting was misinterpreted as the Kal grunting.
5. The Kal's grunt was not a response to Ca'daan, but rather a coincidence.
6. The statement is false because the context specifies that Ca'daan heard the Kal grunt, not the other way around.</s>
