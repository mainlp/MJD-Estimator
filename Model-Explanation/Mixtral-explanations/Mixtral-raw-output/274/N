<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The results of even the most well designed epidemiological studies are characterized by this type of uncertainty, though well-designed studies typically report narrower uncertainty bounds around the best estimate than do studies of lesser quality. 
Statement: All studies have the same amount of uncertainty to them. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement is too absolute, as it does not allow for any variation in the amount of uncertainty between studies.
2. The context only talks about "well-designed" and "studies of lesser quality," but the statement makes a blanket claim about "all studies."
3. The context suggests that the amount of uncertainty can vary based on study design and quality, which contradicts the statement's claim of equal uncertainty for all studies.
4. The statement does not take into account the difference in uncertainty bounds between well-designed and lesser quality studies mentioned in the context.
5. The statement fails to consider that the uncertainty in the results of a study can also depend on other factors such as sample size, data quality, and the complexity of the research question.
6. The statement does not specify whether it is referring to the same type of uncertainty mentioned in the context.
7. The statement may be referring to a different type of uncertainty, such as uncertainty in the study's methods or assumptions, which is not addressed in the context.
8. The statement may be assuming that all studies are of equal design and quality, which is not the case as mentioned in the context.
9. The statement may be
