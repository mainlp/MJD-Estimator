<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Kom Ombo is an unusual temple in that it is dedicated to two gods. 
Statement: Rarely visited, Kom Ombo is a strange temple devoted to two gods. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't provide information about the frequency of visits to Kom Ombo, making it unclear if it's visited less frequently than other temples.
2. The context doesn't specify if other temples are also dedicated to two gods, so we can't determine if Kom Ombo is uniquely strange.
3. The term "strange" is subjective and could refer to various aspects of the temple, not necessarily the dual dedication.
4. The context doesn't mention if the strangeness of Kom Ombo is related to the frequency of its visits.</s>
