<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In the short term, U.S. consumers will benefit from cheap imports (as will U.S. multinationals that use parts made in East Asian factories). 
Statement: U.S. consumers and factories in East Asia benefit from imports. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement does not specify if the imports are "cheap," which is a crucial factor in the context.
2. The statement does not indicate that U.S. factories in East Asia benefit, only that U.S. consumers and "East Asia" do, which could potentially exclude U.S. multinationals.
3. The context refers to "U.S. multinationals that use parts made in East Asian factories," while the statement is about "imports," which may not necessarily be the same thing.
4. The statement does not make clear whether the benefits to U.S. consumers and East Asia are in the short term, as mentioned in the context.</s>
