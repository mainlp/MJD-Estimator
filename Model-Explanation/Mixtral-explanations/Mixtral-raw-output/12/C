<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In the short term, U.S. consumers will benefit from cheap imports (as will U.S. multinationals that use parts made in East Asian factories). 
Statement: U.S. consumers and factories in East Asia benefit from imports. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. East Asian factories do not benefit from exports to the U.S.
2. U.S. consumers benefit, but factories in East Asia do not.
3. Only U.S. consumers benefit, not factories in East Asia.
4. The statement doesn't mention U.S. consumers and East Asian factories benefiting from the same imports.
5. The context speaks about cheap imports, while the statement does not necessarily imply cheap imports.
6. The statement is too vague, it doesn't specify the time frame (short term) as mentioned in the context.</s>
