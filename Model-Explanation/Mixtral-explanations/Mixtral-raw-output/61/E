<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: do you really romance 
Statement: Do you really have an affair? 
Answer: [/INST] 1. "Romance" and "affair" can be used interchangeably to refer to a sexual or romantic relationship, particularly when it is illicit or hidden.
2. The context is asking about romancing, and the statement is asking about having an affair, which are the same thing in this context.
3. The use of "do" in the statement is for emphasis, indicating that the context's question about romancing is being restated as a more direct question about having an affair.
4. The statement is a more explicit way of asking about the same thing as the context, which is whether there is a romantic or sexual relationship happening.
5. Both the context and the statement refer to some kind of relationship that is not publicly acknowledged or is being questioned, and "romance" and "affair" can both imply this meaning.</s>
