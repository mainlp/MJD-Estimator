<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: These alone could have valuable uses. 
Statement: They may be valuable. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "they" in the statement refers to the same subject as in the context.
2. The context suggests that the subjects have potential value.
3. The statement expresses the possibility of that potential value.
4. The word "alone" in the context implies that the value exists independently of other factors.
5. The statement does not contradict this implication, as something that is valuable alone could still be valuable.</s>
