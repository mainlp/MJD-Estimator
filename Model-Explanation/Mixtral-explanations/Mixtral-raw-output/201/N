2. The new state might not be separated from Italy by glaciers, but by mountains or another geographical feature.
3. The new state might not be leading the movement to a united Italy, but instead, another state or entity might be leading the movement.
4. The new state might be leading the movement to a united Italy, but the glaciers might not be relevant to the movement or the new state's role in it.

6. The text might be using metaphorical or figurative language, where the "alpine frontier" and "glaciers" do not refer to actual geographical features.</s>
