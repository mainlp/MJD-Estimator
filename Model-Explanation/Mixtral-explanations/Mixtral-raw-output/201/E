<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: On the northwestern Alpine frontier, a new state had appeared on the scene, destined to lead the movement to a united Italy. 
Statement: The alpine frontier was separated from Italy by glaciers. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The new state on the northwestern Alpine frontier is Piedmont-Sardinia, which aimed to unify Italy and had control over some Alpine territories.
2. The "united Italy" referred to in the context is a political concept, not a geographical one, indicating that the new state was working towards creating a single Italian state, which at the time was divided into several states.
3. The glaciers that separated the Alpine frontier from Italy were not insurmountable barriers, allowing for the movement and interaction between the new state and Italy.
4. The new state's location on the Alpine frontier and its desire to lead the movement towards a united Italy implies that it had some level of control or influence over the territories that were geographically part of the Alps but culturally and historically linked to Italy.
5. The context implies that the new state was taking actions or making efforts to unify Italy, and the statement about the glaciers does not contradict this, suggesting that the glaciers did not prevent the new state from pursuing its goal.</s>
