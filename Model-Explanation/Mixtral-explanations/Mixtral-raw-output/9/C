<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added: "He said twice: 'That alters everything.' And I've been thinking.  
Statement: The fact that Styles was at Bauerstein changes everything. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement incorrectly identifies the person who was at Styles, it was Bauerstein who was at Styles, not Styles who was at Bauerstein.
2. The statement misinterprets the phrase "that alters everything," which refers to some unspecified change, not the fact that Styles was at Bauerstein.
3. The statement assumes that the only thing that could alter everything is Styles being at Bauerstein, but the context does not support this assumption.
4. The statement uses the word "fact" incorrectly, as it is not established that Styles being at Bauerstein is a fact.
5. The statement presents a causal relationship between Styles being at Bauerstein and everything being altered, but the context does not support this causal relationship.</s>
