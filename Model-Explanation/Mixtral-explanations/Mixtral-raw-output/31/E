Context: The air is warm. 
Statement: The arid air permeates the surrounding land. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. "Arid air" is another way to describe warm air, as warm air is often associated with aridity.
2. The warm air is spreading and affecting the surrounding land, making it arid.
3. The warm air and arid air are the same thing, thus if the air is warm, it is necessarily arid.
4. The warmer air has caused the land to become more arid, and the arid air is now permeating the surrounding land.
5. The context is describing the same air as the statement, which is both warm and arid and is affecting the surrounding land.</s>
