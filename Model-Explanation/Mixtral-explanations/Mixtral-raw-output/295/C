<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Still, I guess that can be got over. 
Statement: There are some things that you need to ignore. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement "there are some things that you need to ignore" cannot be "got over."
2. Ignoring things is not equivalent to "getting over" them.
3. The statement suggests a permanent attitude towards certain things, while "getting over" implies overcoming a temporary situation.
4. The context refers to something that can be "got over," but the statement does not refer to anything that can be "got over."
5. The statement is unrelated to the context, as it does not address the same subject matter.</s>
