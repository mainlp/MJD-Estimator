<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: An organization's activities, core processes, and resources must be aligned to support its mission and help it achieve its goals. 
Statement: An organization is successful if its activities, resources, and goals align. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions the alignment of an organization's activities, core processes, and resources with its mission and goals, but it does not explicitly state that alignment guarantees success.
2. The context does not provide a definition of success, making it unclear if alignment is a sufficient condition for success.
3. The context does not address the possibility of external factors that could impact an organization's success, even if its activities, resources, and goals align.
4. The context does not specify if there are other factors, besides alignment, that contribute to an organization's success.
5. The context does not clarify if the organization's goals themselves are aligned with its mission, which is a prerequisite for the statement to be true.</s>
