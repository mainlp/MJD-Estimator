<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. 
Statement: The calculation of Japan's year of foundation was very exact. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The Chinese calendar's 1,260-year cycle may not directly translate to exact calculations in the Japanese context.
2. The conversion of Chinese cosmological years to Japanese foundation years may involve additional factors or approximations.
3. The precision of the Chinese calendar might not ensure the exactness of the calculated year of Japan's foundation.
4. The context does not specify if other methods or calendars were used in the calculation, which could affect the exactness.
5. The term "exact" in the statement could have different interpretations, such as precise or accurate, which may not both apply to the calculation.
6. The calculation's exactness might be influenced by uncertainties in the starting point of the Chinese cosmological cycle.
7. The context does not provide information on potential errors or margins of error in the calculation, leaving the exactness undetermined.
8. The conversion of Chinese calendar units to Japanese foundation years might involve complexities or inexact transformations.
9. The statement's exactness could be contingent on the accuracy of historical records about Japan's foundation year.
10. The calculation's exactness may
