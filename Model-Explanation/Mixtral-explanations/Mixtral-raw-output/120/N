<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Even if auditors do not follow such other standards and methodologies, they may still serve as a useful source of guidance to auditors in planning their work under GAGAS. 
Statement: GAGAS requires strict compliance for auditors to follow. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions that other standards and methodologies "may still serve as a useful source of guidance," but it does not specify whether GAGAS requires strict compliance.
2. The context suggests that GAGAS has its own guidelines for auditors, but it does not indicate that following other standards is forbidden or required.
3. The statement could be true or false, as the context does not provide enough information to determine whether GAGAS requires strict compliance for auditors to follow.
4. The term "strict compliance" is not defined or explained in the context, making it difficult to determine whether it is a requirement under GAGAS.
5. The context focuses on the usefulness of other standards and methodologies for planning work under GAGAS, but it does not address the issue of compliance requirements.
6. The statement assumes that GAGAS has a uniform compliance requirement, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this assumption.
7. The statement may be true or false depending on the specific requirements of GAGAS, which are not fully explained in the context.
8. The context does not indicate whether GAGAS allows for any flexibility or discretion in following other standards
