<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In his effort to build nationalism across Turkey in the 1920s, Ataterk instituted a campaign to suppress Kurdish identity that continues today. 
Statement: In 1942, Ataterk tried to build nationalism in Turkey. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Ataturk may have attempted to promote a different type of nationalism in 1942, not related to the suppression of Kurdish identity.
2. The context refers to Ataturk's efforts to build nationalism in the 1920s, but the statement refers to 1942, and his actions towards nationalism may have changed during that time period.
3. The statement does not specify what actions Ataturk took in 1942 to build nationalism, so it is unclear if they were related to the suppression of Kurdish identity.
4. It is possible that Ataturk's campaign to suppress Kurdish identity had not yet begun in 1942.
5. The statement does not provide information on the success or failure of Ataturk's efforts to build nationalism in 1942, so it is unclear if they were significant or impactful.</s>
