<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In his effort to build nationalism across Turkey in the 1920s, Ataterk instituted a campaign to suppress Kurdish identity that continues today. 
Statement: In 1942, Ataterk tried to build nationalism in Turkey. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Ataturk passed away in 1938, so he could not have taken action in 1942.
2. Ataturk's efforts to build nationalism did not extend beyond the 1920s.
3. Ataturk's campaign to suppress Kurdish identity was separate from his efforts to build nationalism.
4. The campaign to suppress Kurdish identity was not an attempt to build nationalism.
5. Any attempts to build nationalism after Ataturk's death would not be attributable to him.
6. The statement is incorrect because it lacks specific information about what actions Ataturk took in 1942 to build nationalism.
7. The statement is false because Ataturk's policies towards Kurdish identity were actually aimed at weakening, not strengthening, nationalism.</s>
