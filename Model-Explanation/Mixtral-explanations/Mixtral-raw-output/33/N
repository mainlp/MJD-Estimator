2. The news could be only referring to "system administrators" in the context, and not users when discussing the lack of prioritization of security.
3. The users may generally pick obvious, easily cracked passwords due to lack of knowledge about security best practices, not necessarily because they do not prioritize security.
4. The system administrators may be ignoring basic security precautions due to lack of resources or constraints, not because they do not prioritize security.
5. Both users and system administrators may prioritize other aspects of computer usage over security, leading to the observed behavior without either party explicitly not prioritizing security.</s>
