<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He threw one of them and shot the other. 
Statement: He shot his gun. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "other" that he shot refers to his gun.
2. He used his gun to shoot something else, not a person or animal.
3. He first threw one object and then shot his gun, which is considered "the other."
4. The gun was already loaded and ready to use, so shooting it didn't require any additional actions beyond pulling the trigger.
5. The statement is true in a figurative or metaphorical sense, where "shoot" means to do something quickly or decisively, and his gun is a symbol of his ability to act in this way.</s>
