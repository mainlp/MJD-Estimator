<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: ooh it's kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh Knots Landing 
Statement: I only watch frivolous things on Thursday nights. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions one specific frivolous show, "Knots Landing," but does not explicitly state that it's the only frivolous show the speaker watches on Thursday nights.
2. The context indicates the speaker watches "some of those frivolous things" but does not confirm that the speaker watches exclusively frivolous things on Thursday nights.
3. The speaker's statement "it's kind of tough to think of some of the others" could imply that they watch other non-frivolous shows as well.
4. The context refers to watching shows after aerobics at nine o'clock, but the statement does not specify a time, leaving room for the possibility of watching frivolous shows at other times on Thursdays.
5. The term "frivolous" might not be interpreted consistently between the speaker and the listener, making the statement undetermined.</s>
