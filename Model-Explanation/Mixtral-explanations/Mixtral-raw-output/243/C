<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died 
Statement: We were very lucky to get the van given how new it was. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The van was not obtained through luck; it was bought from an estate sale.
2. The van was not particularly new at the time of purchase, as the previous owner had already used it.
3. The statement implies that getting the van was a fortunate occurrence, but the context suggests that the speaker doesn't consider it important or remarkable.
4. The statement suggests that the newness of the van was a significant factor, but the context indicates that other factors (such as it being an estate sale) were more relevant.
5. The statement implies that the acquisition of the van was positive, while the context implies that it was a necessity (since they had to buy a van) rather than a fortunate event.</s>
