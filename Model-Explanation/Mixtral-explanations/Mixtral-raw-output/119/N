Statement: Small colleges usually have trouble with funding and resources. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only acknowledges the possibility of small colleges struggling with funding, but does not confirm or deny it.
2. The context states that higher level education is generally well-funded, which could include small colleges.
3. The context mentions that there are small colleges facing funding issues, but it does not specify if all small colleges have this problem.
4. The statement is a generalization, while the context refers to specific cases, making it difficult to determine if the statement is true or false based on the context.
5. The context may suggest that the speaker is not knowledgeable about the funding situation of small colleges, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about the statement.</s>
