<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Other functional components of the Postal Service are presumed here not to exhibit significant scale economies, although this has not been demonstrated. 
Statement: The Postal Service only operates very large scale economies. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could be referring to functional components other than the ones specified in the context.
2. The context mentions the lack of demonstration of significant scale economies in other functional components, but it does not explicitly state that there are no scale economies at all.
3. The statement may be using "only" to mean "primarily" or "most significantly," rather than as an absolute exclusion.
4. The context does not specify whether the statement is true or false, as it only discusses other functional components and not the Postal Service as a whole.
5. The statement may be referring to a different time period or set of circumstances than those discussed in the context.
6. The statement may be assuming a different definition or interpretation of "scale economies" than the one used in the context.
7. The context does not provide enough information to determine whether the Postal Service has any functional components that do not exhibit significant scale economies.</s>
