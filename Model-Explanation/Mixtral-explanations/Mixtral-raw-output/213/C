2. FGD systems are not built using SCR systems as a model or template.
3. FGD systems do not have the same design or functionality as SCR systems.
4. FGD systems are not adapted from SCR systems.
5. SCR systems are not a basis for the construction of FGD systems.
6. FGD systems and SCR systems are not interchangeable or similar in any way.
7. FGD systems are not a type of SCR system.
8. SCR systems are not integrated into FGD systems.
9. FGD systems do not perform the same functions as SCR systems.
10. There is no relationship between FGD systems and SCR systems in terms of construction or operation.</s>
