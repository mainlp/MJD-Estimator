<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It is not a surprise, either, that Al Pacino chews the scenery in Devil's Advocate . And the idea that if the devil showed up on Earth he'd be running a New York corporate-law firm is also, to say the least, pre-chewed. 
Statement: Nobody expects that the devil would take the form of a lawyer. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context refers to the idea of the devil taking the form of a corporate-law firm owner, not specifically a lawyer.
2. The context mentions Al Pacino's character chewing the scenery, but it doesn't explicitly state whether this character is recognized as the devil by others in the movie.
3. The context states that the idea is "pre-chewed," which could imply that it's a common or expected concept, but it doesn't confirm that nobody in particular has this expectation.
4. The context doesn't address the expectations of every individual, so it's possible that some people might still expect the devil to take a different form.
5. The context doesn't specify whether the statement refers to real-world expectations or the expectations of characters within the movie.</s>
