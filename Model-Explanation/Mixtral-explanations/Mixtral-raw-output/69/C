2. He viewed the pictures in a book or online.
3. He was referring to different "things" than in the original statement.
4. He had a memory of the images, but didn't physically see them recently.
5. He lied about seeing the pictures recently.
6. He was joking about having seen the pictures.
7. He was confused about when he last saw the pictures.
8. He has some form of mental time travel ability and considers his mental revisiting of the images as "seeing" them recently.
9. He has a unique memory condition where he can access images from his past as if he saw them recently.
10. He has a rare form of synesthesia where certain concepts or words trigger the visualization of specific images.
