<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Changes in technology and its application to electronic commerce and expanding Internet applications will change the specific control activities that may be employed and how they are implemented, but the basic requirements of control will not have changed. 
Statement: Technology will make it so we have less control of activities. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not specify what type of control activities are being referred to, so it is unclear if the statement applies to them.
2. The context states that the "basic requirements of control" will not change, but does not clarify if the concept of "control" in the statement refers to these basic requirements or something else.
3. The context suggests that technology may change how control activities are implemented, but it does not indicate whether this will result in less control.
4. The context does not provide information on the specific impact of technology on the level of control, making it difficult to determine if the statement is true or false.
5. The context does not specify if the control is being taken away from humans or if it is being redistributed in a different way.
6. The context does not specify if the control is being reduced in all areas or just certain ones.
7. The context does not specify if the control is being replaced by something else or if it is just being changed.
8. The context does not specify if the control is being lost or if it is being gained in other areas.</s>
