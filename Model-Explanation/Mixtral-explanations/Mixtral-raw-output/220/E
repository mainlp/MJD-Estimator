<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Although the accounting and reporting model needs to be updated, in my view, the current attest and assurance model is also out of date. 
Statement: The accounting model needs to be updated in addition to the acquisition model. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could be true if the "accounting model" in the statement refers to the same concept as the "accounting and reporting model" in the context.
2. The statement could be true if the "attest and assurance model" in the context is synonymous with the "acquisition model" in the statement, and should also be updated.
3. The statement could be true if the speaker has additional information that suggests the "acquisition model" also needs to be updated, even though it was not explicitly mentioned in the context.
4. The statement could be true if the speaker is using "in addition to" to mean "similarly to," indicating that both the accounting model and the acquisition model need to be updated, even though only the accounting model was mentioned in the context.</s>
