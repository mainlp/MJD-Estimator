<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: We still espouse a God-given right of human beings to use the environment for their benefit, says Barrett Duke of the Southern Baptists. 
Statement: Human beings are entitled to the environment. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The term "use the environment" in the context may not necessarily mean "entitled to" the environment, but rather the right to interact with it in a responsible way.
2. The context does not specify if "use the environment" refers to all aspects of the environment, or only certain parts or resources.
3. The statement does not clarify if entitlement implies ownership, which is not addressed in the context.
4. The context might interpret entitlement as a short-term benefit, while the statement may imply long-term entitlement.
5. The term "God-given" in the context could imply a specific moral framework that may not align with all interpretations of entitlement.
6. The context does not indicate if there are any limitations or conditions on the entitlement of human beings to the environment.
7. The statement does not specify if entitlement is collective or individual in nature.
8. The context may view entitlement as a privilege, while the statement may imply it as a right.
9. The term "use" in the context could be interpreted in various ways, and the statement does not account for these different interpretations.
