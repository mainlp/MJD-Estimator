Context: yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it it would be so good it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer 
Statement: I am glad our generation has no debt. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement does not specify whose "generation" they are referring to, and the speaker is discussing both their generation and the hypothetical next generation.
2. The speaker expresses that their generation might not have debt, but they would still have to adjust to living with what they can afford.
3. The speaker does not explicitly mention if they are glad that their generation has no debt or if they are implying that they wish they had no debt.
4. The speaker is discussing the potential benefits for the generation after them if their generation doesn't accrue debt, not necessarily the current state of their generation.
5. The speaker's use of "if" and "would" in the context suggests a hypothetical situation, not a factual statement about the current state of their generation.
6. The speaker's mention of being "spoiled" and having to live with what they can afford suggests that their generation may still be struggling with debt or the desire to live beyond their means.
7. The statement "I am glad our generation has no debt" is not directly expressed in the context, it is an assumption made by the reader.</s>
