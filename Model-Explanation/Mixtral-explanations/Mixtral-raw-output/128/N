<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The conspiracy-minded allege that the chains also leverage their influence to persuade the big publishers to produce more blockbusters at the expense of moderate-selling books. 
Statement: Big publishers want to produce more high budget films, even if that means badly selling books. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement refers to "high budget films," while the context discusses "blockbusters" and "moderate-selling books." It's unclear if high budget films and blockbusters are equivalent.
2. The statement talks about "big publishers," but it's undetermined if these publishers are the same as the ones mentioned in the context.
3. The context suggests that chains influence publishers to produce more blockbusters, but it doesn't specify if this is at the expense of high budget films.
4. The statement doesn't clarify if the big publishers' desire for high budget films is due to the chains' influence or other factors.
5. The context discusses the persuasion of publishers by chains, but the statement doesn't indicate if such persuasion is involved in the publishers' decision to produce high budget films.
6. The context refers to books, while the statement refers to films, and it's unclear if they're related or if the publishers are involved in both.
7. The statement doesn't provide information on how badly selling books are affected by the publishers' focus on high budget films.</s>
