<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Then you're ready for the fray, either in the bustling great bazaars such as Delhi's Chandni Chowk or Mumbai's Bhuleshwar, or the more sedate ambience of grander shops and showrooms. 
Statement: All of the great bazaars are bustling at all times. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions two specific bustling great bazaars, Delhi's Chandni Chowk and Mumbai's Bhuleshwar, without making a claim about all great bazaars.
2. The context does not provide information about the bazaars' busy hours, so it's unclear if all great bazaars are bustling at all times.
3. The statement might be too broad, assuming that all great bazaars, regardless of their location or type, are bustling at all times.
4. The context does not specify if the great bazaars have consistent busy hours or if they vary, making the statement undetermined.
5. The statement might not account for the more sedate ambience of grander shops and showrooms mentioned in the context, which could impact the bazaars' busy status.</s>
