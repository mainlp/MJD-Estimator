<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: We always knew it was an outside chance. 
Statement: We were never assured of it happening in time and we knew this full well. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't directly refer to the same event as the context.
2. The context refers to something happening in time, but the statement does not explicitly confirm this.
3. The statement expresses doubt or uncertainty, but the context does not indicate whether this doubt was resolved.
4. The context implies a small possibility, and the statement does not contradict this, but it also does not confirm it.
5. The statement could be referring to a different aspect of the situation, unrelated to the timing mentioned in the context.
6. The context uses the phrase "an outside chance", which could mean a very small possibility, but the statement does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this.
7. The statement might be expressing a different level of certainty than the context, leading to a neutral inference.
8. The context and the statement might be expressing two different perspectives on the same event, leading to a neutral inference.</s>
