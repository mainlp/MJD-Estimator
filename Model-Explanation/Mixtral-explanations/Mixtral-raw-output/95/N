2. The context specifies that emissions data includes the power sector, but the statement does not mention whether it includes emissions from all sectors.
3. The context uses "total" to describe the emissions, while the statement uses "the" before "total," which could imply different scopes of emissions.
4. The context and statement both mention NOx and SO2 emissions, but it is unclear if they are presented together or separately in Exhibit 3.
5. The context and statement may be using different definitions or methods for calculating emissions, leading to potential discrepancies.
6. The context might be outdated or inaccurate, while the statement reflects the current or accurate data.
7. The statement might be referring to a specific subset of data within Exhibit 3, which does not represent the total regional emissions.
8. The context and statement may have different time frames associated with the emissions data.
9. The statement may be implying that Exhibit 3 only contains emissions data for certain regions, while the context is referring
