<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The street ends at Taksim Square (Taksim Meydane), the heart of modern Istanbul, lined with luxurious five-star hotels and the glass-fronted Ataturk Cultural Centre (Ataturk Keleter Sarayy), also called the Opera House. 
Statement: The street is quite a luxurious one. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions that there are luxurious five-star hotels along the street, but it does not specify if the rest of the street shares the same level of luxury.
2. The statement could be referring to the overall atmosphere or vibe of the street, which might feel luxurious without all buildings being luxurious.
3. The street might have a mix of both luxurious and non-luxurious buildings, making it difficult to determine if the statement is true or false.
4. The statement might be referring to the presence of the five-star hotels, but it does not necessarily mean that the entire street is luxurious.
5. The Ataturk Cultural Centre, also known as the Opera House, might not contribute to the luxuriousness of the street.
6. The context does not provide enough information about the street's condition, cleanliness, or other factors that might influence its perceived luxuriousness.
7. The statement might be based on the speaker's subjective interpretation of luxury, which might not align with the common understanding of the term.</s>
