<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer 
Statement: It is better to plant when it is colder. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context implies that planting at the beginning of warmer weather has no negative impact.
2. This suggests that planting at a later time, when it is colder, could also be viable.
3. The statement directly contradicts the context, stating that it is actually better to plant when it is colder.
4. The context may be referring to a specific type of plant that does not require cold weather for planting.
5. The statement, however, is a generalization that colder weather is better for planting all types of plants.</s>
