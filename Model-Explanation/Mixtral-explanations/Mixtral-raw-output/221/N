<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: After shuttering the DOE, Clinton could depict himself as a crusader against waste and bureaucracy who succeeded where even Reagan failed. 
Statement: Reagan had tried to shutter the DOE but was unable to. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The text does not provide information on whether Clinton was aware of Reagan's attempt to shutter the DOE.
2. The text does not specify if Clinton's methods or reasons for trying to shutter the DOE were similar to Reagan's.
3. The context does not indicate whether Clinton's success was due to factors unrelated to his crusade against waste and bureaucracy.
4. The text does not provide information on the timeline of events, so it's unclear if Clinton's actions occurred after Reagan's attempt.
5. The statement doesn't mention if Clinton ever publicly acknowledged or credited Reagan's attempt in his own efforts.
6. The context doesn't reveal if Clinton's success was influenced by changes in the political climate or other external factors since Reagan's time.
7. The statement doesn't clarify if Clinton's success was complete, meaning the DOE was permanently closed, or partial, such as a reduction in size or budget.</s>
