3. The context does not specify when or where Deborah Pryce said the words, so it's possible that she has not said it to the public yet.
4. The statement does not specify that Deborah Pryce said the words "to the public" directly after "A $200,000 federal grant will be received by Ohio Legal Services," so it's possible that she said something else in between.
5. The statement does not specify that Deborah Pryce is the only one who said the words, so it's possible that someone else said it on her behalf.
6. The context does not specify whether the grant has been officially awarded, so it's possible that Deborah Pryce is only announcing the intention to award the grant.
7. The context does not specify
