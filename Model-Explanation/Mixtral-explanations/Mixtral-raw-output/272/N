<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 'Dave Hanson, to whom nothing was impossible.' Well, we have a nearly impossible task: a task of engineering and building. 
Statement: This building job is almost impossible, even for an experienced engineer. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context refers to Dave Hanson's general ability to accomplish anything, but it does not specify his expertise in building or engineering.
2. The statement does not indicate whether Dave Hanson will be involved in the building task.
3. The term "nearly impossible" in the context might not be equivalent to "almost impossible" in the statement, leading to a lack of clarity.
4. The context does not provide information about the specific challenges of the building job, making it unclear if Dave Hanson could overcome them.
5. The statement does not specify if the experienced engineer is comparable to Dave Hanson in terms of skills and abilities.</s>
