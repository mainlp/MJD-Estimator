<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The original wax models of the river gods are on display in the Civic Museum. 
Statement: They have models made out of clay. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not specify if the clay models are in the same museum or associated with the wax models of the river gods.
2. The statement does not indicate who "they" refers to, and it could be a different group from those who created the wax models.
3. The statement does not specify if the clay models are related to river gods or a different subject.
4. The context does not provide information about any clay models, so it is unclear if they even exist.
5. The statement does not provide information about the size, age, or condition of the clay models, making it difficult to determine if they are related to the wax models.</s>
