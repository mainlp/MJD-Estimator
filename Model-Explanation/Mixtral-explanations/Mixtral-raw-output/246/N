<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: What Ellison is doing here, as Hemingway did, is equating the process of becoming an artist with that of becoming a man. 
Statement: Ellison and Hemingway took different ways to compare becoming a man. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't specify what those "different ways" are, so we don't know if they are indeed different from each other.
2. It's possible that the differences referred to are not about the process of becoming a man, but rather other aspects of their lives or works.
3. The context speaks of "equating" the process of becoming an artist with that of becoming a man, not comparing. So, it's unclear if the statement is consistent with the context.
4. The statement could be true, but it doesn't necessarily contradict or support the context, making it neutral.
5. The scope of "here" in the context is unclear. If it refers to a specific work or phase of Ellison's career, the statement might not apply.
6. The statement is ambiguous about whether "Ellison and Hemingway" refers to the authors themselves or their characters or works.</s>
