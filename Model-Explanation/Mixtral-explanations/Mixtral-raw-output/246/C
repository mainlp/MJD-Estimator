<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: What Ellison is doing here, as Hemingway did, is equating the process of becoming an artist with that of becoming a man. 
Statement: Ellison and Hemingway took different ways to compare becoming a man. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Ellison and Hemingway both equated, not compared, becoming an artist with becoming a man.
2. The equivalence drawn between becoming an artist and becoming a man was similar for both Ellison and Hemingway.
3. There is no evidence of Hemingway comparing becoming a man with any other process, let alone the process of becoming an artist.
4. The context does not suggest that Ellison took multiple ways to compare becoming a man; he equated it with becoming an artist.
5. The statement is not considering the context that the comparison made by both authors is equating, not comparing in general.
6. The process of becoming an artist and becoming a man was not compared in different ways by Ellison and Hemingway, but equated in a similar way.
7. The statement incorrectly implies that there are different comparisons made by both authors, while the context specifies an equivalence.
8. The statement fails to recognize that the comparison is a specific type of equating, and thus misinterprets the context.</s>
