<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: General Motors, for instance, lost $460 million to strikes in 1997, but investors treated the costs as a kind of extraordinary charge and valued the company as if the losses had never happened. 
Statement: GM lost a lot almost a million dollars in labor disputes. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could be referring to a different time period than 1997, so it's unclear if the losses are included in the $460 million mentioned in the context.
2. The statement could be referring to losses from labor disputes beyond just strikes, which were specifically mentioned in the context.
3. The phrase "almost a million dollars" is vague - it could mean $900,000 or it could mean $999,999, which may or may not be significant compared to the $460 million loss mentioned in the context.
4. The statement could be referring to cumulative losses over multiple years or multiple disputes, rather than losses from a single event or time period.
5. The investors' treatment of the costs as an "extraordinary charge" might not apply to the specific losses mentioned in the statement, depending on the details of those losses.</s>
