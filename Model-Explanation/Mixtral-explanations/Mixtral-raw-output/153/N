<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: EPA estimates that 5.6 million acres of lakes, estuaries and wetlands and 43,500 miles of streams, rivers and coasts are impaired by mercury emissions. 
Statement: The release of mercury has an impact on rivers, streams and lakes 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't specify whether the impact is positive or negative.
2. The context only mentions impairment, not impact in general.
3. The statement includes "rivers, streams and lakes," but the context only specifically mentions "streams, rivers and coasts" for water bodies impaired by mercury emissions.
4. The context could imply that mercury only impacts a subset of these water bodies, not all of them.
5. The statement doesn't clarify the extent or nature of the impact.</s>
