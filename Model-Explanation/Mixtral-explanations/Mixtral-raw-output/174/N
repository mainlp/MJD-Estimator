<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: No, I exclaimed, astonished.  
Statement: I said no to him several time, utterly surprised by the change of events.  
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context doesn't specify that the "I" in the statement and the "I" in the context are the same person.
2. The context doesn't indicate that the speaker in the context is referring to the same situation as the speaker in the statement.
3. The statement doesn't specify who "him" refers to, so it's unclear if it's the same person being referred to in the context.
4. The context doesn't provide enough information about the speaker's level of surprise, making it unclear if it's the same as the surprise mentioned in the statement.
5. The statement doesn't specify the nature of the change of events, so it's unclear if it's the same change referred to in the context.
6. The context doesn't indicate how many times the speaker said no, making it unclear if it's the same number of times mentioned in the statement.
7. The statement doesn't indicate the time frame in which the speaker said no several times, making it unclear if it's the same time frame as the one in the context.</s>
