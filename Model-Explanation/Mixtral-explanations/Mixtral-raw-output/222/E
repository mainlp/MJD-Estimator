<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?" Poirot smiled.  
Statement: How did you work out from that text that there was a new will? 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "scribbled words" on the envelope suggest recent activity or hastiness, indicating a new document.
2. The word "yesterday" in the context points to a time close to the discovery, aligning with the creation of a new will.
3. The term "afternoon" further narrows down the time frame, making it likely that the will was made during that specific time yesterday.
4. The combination of these factors - the scribbled words, the mention of "yesterday," and the specification of "afternoon" - allude to the creation of a new will.</s>
