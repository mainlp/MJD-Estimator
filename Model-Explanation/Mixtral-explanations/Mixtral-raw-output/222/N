<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Tell me, how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon?" Poirot smiled.  
Statement: How did you work out from that text that there was a new will? 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement does not provide the actual content of the "scribbled words" on the envelope.
2. The context does not specify that the only possible source of information about the will is the scribbled words.
3. The statement asks about "that text," but it is unclear if this refers to the same thing as the "scribbled words" on the envelope.
4. The context indicates that Poirot smiled, which could suggest that the discovery was not straightforward, making it unclear how the scribbled words directly led to the discovery of the will.
5. The statement is asking about how Poirot worked out there was a "new" will, but the context only mentions that a will was made yesterday afternoon, which could have been an update to an existing will.</s>
