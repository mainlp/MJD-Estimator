Statement: You are required to sign up for a major freshman year. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The school's policy regarding major selection may have changed between the speaker's sophomore and senior years.
2. The speaker's statement "we wanted... to sign up for majors" could imply that it was at the end of their sophomore year that they were first allowed to choose a major.
3. The speaker might have been unaware of the major selection process during their freshman year.
4. The school may not have required students to declare a major until the end of their sophomore year.
5. The speaker's use of "we" could mean a specific group of students who were allowed to choose their major at the end of their sophomore year, not all students.
6. The statement could be contextually or factually inaccurate, as the speaker's account is based on their personal recollection.</s>
