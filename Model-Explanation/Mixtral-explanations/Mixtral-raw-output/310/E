Statement: You are required to sign up for a major freshman year. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context mentions signing up for majors during sophomore year, implying that it typically occurs after freshman year.
2. The speaker's decision to major in a subject is influenced by their experience in chemistry, suggesting that they had not yet chosen a major during freshman year.
3. The structure and requirements of the school system are such that students are not required to declare a major until a certain point, allowing for exploration of different subjects, as in this case.</s>
