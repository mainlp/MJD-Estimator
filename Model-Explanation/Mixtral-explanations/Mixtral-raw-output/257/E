Context: When he's ready for a major strike, how many innocents do you suppose are going to suffer? To quote one of your contemporaries; 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.' ' 
Statement: If he does a big strike, many people will suffer. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "major strike" referred to in the context implies harm or negative consequences for some individuals.
2. The context quotes a statement from a contemporary about the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few, suggesting that the many will be prioritized over the few in this situation.
3. The statement specifies that "many people will suffer" if the major strike occurs, aligning with the context's implication of harm for some individuals.
4. The statement does not specify who the "many people" are, allowing for the possibility that they include both the intended targets and potential innocents.
5. The context's mention of "innocents" who may suffer during the strike supports the inference that the "many people" in the statement could include these innocents.
6. The statement's use of "will" indicates a high degree of certainty or expectation, consistent with the context's implication that harm is likely to occur during the strike.</s>
