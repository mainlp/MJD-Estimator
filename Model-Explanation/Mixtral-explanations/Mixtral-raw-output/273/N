<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 36 AC usage nationally for mercury control from power plants should be roughly proportional to the total MWe of coal-fired facilities that are equipped with the technology (this assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent and other assumptions of Tables 4-4 and 4-5). 
Statement: Power plants' mercury control AC usage is higher than total MWe from coal facilities. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not specify the time period being considered.
2. The statement could be true if some coal-fired facilities without the technology are included in the total MWe.
3. The context assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent, but the actual capacity factor might be different.
4. The statement could be true if some of the AC usage is for purposes other than mercury control.
5. The context is based on Tables 4-4 and 4-5, but the statement's truthfulness could depend on other factors not mentioned in the tables.
6. The statement does not specify whether it is referring to a specific region or nationally, which could affect the comparison.
7. The statement could be true if the power plants have increased in efficiency since the data in the context was collected.
8. The context does not specify if the AC usage includes only coal-fired facilities or also other types of power plants.
9. The statement could be true if there are errors or inaccuracies in the data used in the context.
10. The statement could be true if there are differences in the types of mercury control technology used in the power plants.</s>
