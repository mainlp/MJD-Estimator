<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 36 AC usage nationally for mercury control from power plants should be roughly proportional to the total MWe of coal-fired facilities that are equipped with the technology (this assumes an average capacity factor of 85 percent and other assumptions of Tables 4-4 and 4-5). 
Statement: Power plants' mercury control AC usage is higher than total MWe from coal facilities. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement contradicts the assumption of proportionality between AC usage for mercury control and the total MWe of equipped coal-fired facilities.
2. The statement implies that AC usage for mercury control exceeds the total generation capacity of coal-fired facilities, which is unlikely.
3. The statement suggests that AC usage for mercury control is higher than the actual power output from coal-fired facilities, which is counterintuitive.
4. The statement contradicts the context's assumption of an average capacity factor of 85 percent for coal-fired facilities.
5. The statement implies that the technology for mercury control requires more energy than the actual power generation of coal-fired facilities, which is implausible.
6. The statement contradicts the data and assumptions presented in Tables 4-4 and 4-5.
7. The statement suggests that the power plants are using more energy for mercury control than for generating power, which is unlikely.
8. The statement implies that the power plants' mercury control system consumes more energy than the total energy produced by the coal-fired facilities, which is impractical.</s>
