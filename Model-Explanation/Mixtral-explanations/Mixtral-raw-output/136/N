<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He touched it and felt his skin swelling and growing hot. 
Statement: His skin was burning. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions skin swelling and growing hot, not explicitly stating that it was burning.
2. There is no direct mention of fire or high temperatures that would cause skin to burn.
3. The statement could be interpreted as a metaphorical use of the word "burning," which is not addressed in the context.
4. The context might be referring to a non-thermal sensation that could cause skin to swell and grow hot, but not necessarily burn.
5. The intensity of the heat is not specified in the context, leaving open the possibility that it was not hot enough to cause burning.
6. The context does not clarify if any other factors could have contributed to the skin's reaction, such as an allergic reaction or medical condition.</s>
