<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The NYT , in its front-page coverage, says the plane was flying far lower than the rules for training missions allow. 
Statement: The NYT reported that training missions did allow for planes to fly that low. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The NYT mentioned a specific altitude limit for training missions that is lower than the altitude the plane was flying.
2. The context implies that the plane was flying at an altitude that is not allowed for training missions, but the statement incorrectly interprets this as the rules allowing for planes to fly that low.
3. The NYT reported on a change in regulations for training missions that allows for lower altitudes, but the statement misrepresents this as the historical norm.
4. The NYT reported that the training missions in question were simulated, allowing for lower altitudes than regular training missions.
5. The statement is a deliberate misinterpretation of the context for misleading purposes.
6. The NYT used the term "allow" in a non-prescriptive sense, simply stating that training missions do not prohibit low altitudes, when in fact they recommend against it.
7. The statement fails to consider the possibility of exceptions or special circumstances in which training missions might allow for lower altitudes.
8. The NYT reported that the rules for training missions have recently changed to allow for lower altitudes, but the statement neglects to mention this context.
9. The
