<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Just like we have hairpins and powder-puffs." Tommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began writing busily. 
Statement: Tommy handed Tuppence an empty shabby green notebook. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The text does not specify whether the notebook is empty or not when Tommy hands it to Tuppence.
2. The word "shabby" could describe the outside appearance of the notebook, but not its interior pages, which could still be blank.
3. The context does not provide information about Tommy's intentions for handing over the notebook, so it's unclear if he knew it was empty or not.
4. Tuppence's busily writing after receiving the notebook does not necessarily mean she wrote in the notebook Tommy gave her; she could have been writing in a different notebook or on a piece of paper.
5. The notebook's condition ("shabby") does not inherently indicate whether it is empty or not, as a used notebook can also be shabby.</s>
