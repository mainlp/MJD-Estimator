<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: If you have the energy to climb the 387 steps to the top of the south tower, you will be rewarded with a stunning view over the city. 
Statement: The south tower has the best view in the city. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions the view from the top of the south tower after climbing 387 steps, but it does not compare it to the views from other towers or locations in the city.
2. The statement that the south tower has the "best" view is subjective and depends on individual preferences for views.
3. The context does not specify if there are other towers or locations in the city that could have a better view than the south tower.
4. The statement assumes that the south tower has the best view in the city, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm or deny this claim.
5. The context focuses on the energy required to climb the steps to the top of the south tower and the reward of a stunning view, but it does not address the relative quality of the view compared to other locations in the city.</s>
