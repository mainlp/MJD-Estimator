<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Under the budget deal, by 2002, national defense will consume about $273 billion a year compared with $267 billion now. 
Statement: The United States national defense budget will increase by 6 billion dollars. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement is false because the national defense budget will not increase by 6 billion dollars, but rather decrease by 4 billion dollars.
2. The statement is false because the context refers to the budget for a specific year (2002), not an increase from the current year.
3. The statement is false because it implies an absolute increase of 6 billion dollars, when in fact the budget will only increase by 6 billion dollars relative to the current year's budget.
4. The statement is false because it does not take into account inflation, which could reduce the actual purchasing power of the budget increase.
5. The statement is false because it does not consider changes in the value of the dollar, which could also affect the real value of the budget increase.
6. The statement is false because it does not account for other factors that could affect the defense budget, such as changes in the overall economy, government priorities, or unforeseen events.</s>
