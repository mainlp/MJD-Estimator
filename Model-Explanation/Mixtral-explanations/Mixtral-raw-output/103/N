<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: There are many such at the present time. 
Statement: There are over two currently. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The term "such" in the context could refer to a variety of things, not specifically what's mentioned in the statement.
2. The statement doesn't specify what "two" refers to, which could be different from "such" in the context.
3. The context uses the phrase "at the present time," while the statement says "currently," which could refer to different time frames.
4. The quantity mentioned in the statement, "over two," could be interpreted as equal to or more than two, which could or could not fall into the category of "many" mentioned in the context.</s>
