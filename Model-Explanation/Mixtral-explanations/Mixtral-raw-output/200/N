<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations 
Statement: It also opens the door to move marketing calls. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions "phone solicitations," which is not equivalent to "marketing calls."
2. It's unclear if the system or tool in question (implied by the context) has the specific capability to filter marketing calls.
3. The statement may be assuming a broader scope of "opens you to" than what the context implies.
4. The context could be referring to a specific instance of phone solicitations, while the statement generalizes it to all marketing calls.
5. The statement might be referring to a different type of marketing calls (telemarketing, email marketing, etc.) than what the context implies.
6. The context may not cover all possible phone solicitations, leaving room for marketing calls to be a separate category.
7. The statement could be interpreted as an inference or assumption, rather than a factual claim based on the context.</s>
