<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: We know they will have to come from the south but that gives them a space as wide as the town in which to launch their attack. 
Statement: The south is totally protected against an attack. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The term "they" in the context could refer to a group that is not located in the south.
2. The "space" mentioned in the context could be referring to a physical distance that the group can use to plan and prepare for an attack, not necessarily that it is unprotected.
3. The context only states that the group will have to come from the south, not that they will be attacking from the south.
4. The "south" in the statement could refer to a different south than the one mentioned in the context.
5. The "protected" in the statement could mean protected in a way that doesn't apply to the context, for example, protected by alliances or technology.
6. The context does not mention anything about the current situation of the south, it could be under attack already.
7. The context does not mention about the defenses of the south, it could be well defended.
8. The context does not mention about the size of the town, the south could be much larger and have more resources to protect it.
9. The context does not mention about the number of attackers, there could be too many to be fully protected against.
