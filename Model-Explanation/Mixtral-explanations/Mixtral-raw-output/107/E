<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: We know they will have to come from the south but that gives them a space as wide as the town in which to launch their attack. 
Statement: The south is totally protected against an attack. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context mentions that the only possible direction of attack is from the south.
2. The context also states that the attackers have a wide space, which implies that there are no barriers to prevent an attack from the south.
3. Therefore, the absence of protection in the south allows us to infer that the south is not totally protected against an attack.</s>
