<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Lincoln glared. 
Statement: The man was angry. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions "Lincoln," so it's unclear if "the man" in the statement refers to Lincoln.
2. The statement is more general than the context, as it refers to "a man," not specifically Lincoln.
3. The context describes an action (glaring), but anger can be expressed in various ways, not just through glaring.
4. The context does not provide enough information about Lincoln's emotions or thoughts.
5. The statement is an assumption or inference about Lincoln's emotional state, which might not be accurate.
6. The context and statement might have different timeframes, so the man's anger might not be related to Lincoln's glare.
7. Lincoln's glare could be due to factors other than anger, such as confusion, surprise, or disbelief.
8. The statement is not directly contradicted by the context, but it is not explicitly supported either.
9. The context and statement may have different perspectives or viewpoints, leading to a neutral inference.
10. The context and statement might be from different sources or texts, making it impossible to determine if they refer to the same person or situation
