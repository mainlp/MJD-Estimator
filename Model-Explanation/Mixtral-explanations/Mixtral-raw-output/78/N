Context: He's chosen Meg Ryan. 
Statement: A possible selection would be Meg Ryan or Jon Doe.

6. The context does not indicate if the selection was made before or after the statement "A possible selection would be Meg Ryan or Jon Doe" was made, so it is unclear if the statement is based on outdated information.
7. The context does not provide information about the relationship between Meg Ryan and Jon Doe, so
