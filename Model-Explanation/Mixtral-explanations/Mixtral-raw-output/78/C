<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He's chosen Meg Ryan. 
Statement: A possible selection would be Meg Ryan or Jon Doe. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement implies that Meg Ryan is not the only possible selection, but one option among others, including Jon Doe.
2. The context, however, indicates that Meg Ryan has already been chosen, making Jon Doe an impossible selection.
3. Therefore, the statement is false because it suggests that Jon Doe is still a possible choice when he is not.</s>
