<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The tomb guardian will unlock the gate to the tunnel and give you a candle to explore the small circular catacomb, but for what little you can see, it is hardly worth the effort. 
Statement: The tomb garden can give you a thorough tour of the catacombs. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "catacomb" mentioned in the context is a small circular one, implying that there are likely not many areas to explore.
2. The statement suggests a tour, which does not necessarily mean visiting every single corner of the catacombs, but rather giving an overview of what it contains.
3. The "thorough" in the statement could mean providing a detailed explanation or history of the catacombs, which the tomb guardian may be able to do.
4. The tomb guardian may have additional information about the catacombs that is not immediately visible during the exploration.
5. The guardian's statement about it not being worth the effort might refer to the physical exploration of the catacombs, while a guided tour could still be informative and interesting.</s>
