<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The tomb guardian will unlock the gate to the tunnel and give you a candle to explore the small circular catacomb, but for what little you can see, it is hardly worth the effort. 
Statement: The tomb garden can give you a thorough tour of the catacombs. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions a small circular catacomb, while the statement refers to catacombs in general, which may include additional areas not covered by the guardian's candlelit tunnel.
2. The statement could be referring to a different set of catacombs, not the one mentioned in the context.
3. The guardian may not have permission or authority to allow access to other parts of the tomb, such as the garden, which may contain separate catacombs.
4. The "thorough tour" mentioned in the statement might not necessarily involve physical access, but rather detailed information or a virtual representation of the catacombs.
5. The context suggests that the catacomb is not well-lit and may be difficult to explore, while the statement implies a more organized and well-lit tour experience.
6. The term "tomb garden" in the statement is ambiguous and could refer to a variety of spaces, not necessarily an area containing catacombs.</s>
