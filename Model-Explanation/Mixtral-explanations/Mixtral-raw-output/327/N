<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: They won't be killing off George Clooney's character at ER like they did to Jimmy Smits at NYPD . Instead, Dr. Doug Ross is being forced out over the next two episodes because the maverick heartthrob gives an unauthorized painkiller to a terminally ill boy (Thursday, 10 p.m.). 
Statement: George Clooney will not be getting fired from his TV show. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could refer to any TV show, not just "ER."
2. The statement might be referring to a different character played by George Clooney.
3. The context refers to "killing off" the character, not specifically firing them.
4. The context states that the character is being "forced out," which could include being fired but is not explicitly stated as such.
5. The context refers to events in the future tense ("over the next two episodes"), while the statement is in the present tense.
6. The context refers to a specific reason for the character's departure (giving an unauthorized painkiller to a terminally ill boy), which may not be related to the reason for his firing.
7. The statement is a generalization, while the context is a specific situation. It is possible that George Clooney was fired from a different TV show or at a different time.</s>
