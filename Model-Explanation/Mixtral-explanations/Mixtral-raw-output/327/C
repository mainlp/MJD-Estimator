<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: They won't be killing off George Clooney's character at ER like they did to Jimmy Smits at NYPD . Instead, Dr. Doug Ross is being forced out over the next two episodes because the maverick heartthrob gives an unauthorized painkiller to a terminally ill boy (Thursday, 10 p.m.). 
Statement: George Clooney will not be getting fired from his TV show. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. George Clooney's character, Dr. Doug Ross, is being forced off the TV show "ER," which can be interpreted as getting fired.
2. The reason for his character's departure is related to an unauthorized action (giving an unauthorized painkiller to a terminally ill boy), which could be considered a firing offense.
3. The statement ignores the fact that Dr. Doug Ross's character is being written out of the show, implying that Clooney will still be part of the show.
4. The statement fails to consider that being forced off a TV show due to misconduct is a form of getting fired.
5. The statement is false because George Clooney's character is not leaving the show voluntarily but is being forced out, which can be considered a form of firing.</s>
