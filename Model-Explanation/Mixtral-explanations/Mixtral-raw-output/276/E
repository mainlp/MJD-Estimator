<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He walked out into the street and I followed. 
Statement: I followed him down the street. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "he" referred to in the statement is the same person as the "he" in the context.
2. The action of "walking out into the street" implies that "he" started moving down the street.
3. The use of "followed" in the context indicates that the speaker continued to move in the same direction as "he" after he entered the street.
4. The street is a continuous path, so "following" someone who is moving down it would mean moving in the same direction as them.
5. There are no indications in the context that the speaker stopped following "he" or changed direction.
6. The statement is in the past tense, consistent with the context.
7. The statement is a more specific version of the context, implying that the speaker continued to follow "he" after he started moving down the street.</s>
