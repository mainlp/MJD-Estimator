<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that 
Statement: "I regularly go for a walk or a jog at Washington's." 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context does not indicate the speaker's current habits or routine.
2. The statement could be true or false, as the context does not provide enough information to confirm.
3. The statement might be referring to a different Washington (not the one the speaker is referring to).
4. The speaker in the context might have changed their habits since making the statement.
5. The statement could be true for the person making it, but false for the speaker in the context.
6. The context does not specify the frequency of the speaker's walks or jogs, making a direct comparison difficult.
7. The statement could be true in the present, but was not true when the context was given.
8. The context does not indicate whether the speaker's walks or jogs are solely in Washington or if they could be in other places as well.</s>
