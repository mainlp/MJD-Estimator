<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.  
Statement: The judge ordered the court to be silent. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The text only mentions a "murmur of disapprobation" from the judge, not an order for silence.
2. The statement does not specify whether the judge's murmur was heard by the prisoner or not.
3. The prisoner's angry reaction could have occurred before any order for silence.
4. The statement may be referring to a different judge or court.
5. The context does not explicitly state that the prisoner was making noise, so an order for the court to be silent may not apply to him.
6. The statement may be true, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm it.</s>
