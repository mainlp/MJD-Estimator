<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.  
Statement: The judge ordered the court to be silent. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The judge's murmur of disapproval indicates his displeasure, suggesting he may have previously made an order for silence in the court.
2. The prisoner's angry reaction could have been a response to a disturbance in the court, which the judge decided to address by ordering the court to be silent.
3. The context implies a tense atmosphere in the court, and the judge's murmur could have been a precursor to restoring order, which includes ensuring silence in the court.
4. The judge's murmur might have been a signal for the court to become silent, and the prisoner's reaction could have been due to the timing of the judge's murmur, which was immediate and without warning.
5. The judge's murmur could have been a subtle way of restoring order, and the prisoner's reaction might have been a result of the murmur being misinterpreted as a sign of approval, leading the prisoner to lean forward angrily, which then prompted the judge to explicitly order the court to be silent.</s>
