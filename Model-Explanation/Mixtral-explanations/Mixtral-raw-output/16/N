<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The logic of analysis in case studies is the same 
Statement: The logic for the case studies is the same thing as in the data collection. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context doesn't specify that the logic of data collection is the same as the logic of analysis in case studies.
2. The statement could be undetermined if the logic for data collection is not explicitly defined or explained.
3. The statement is neutral because the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm or contradict it.
4. The term "same thing" in the statement can be ambiguous and open to interpretation.
5. The statement might be assuming that the logic for data collection and analysis in case studies are identical, but the context does not support this assumption.
6. The statement could be referring to a specific type of logic, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if this is the case.
7. The statement might be true if the logic for data collection and analysis in case studies are the same, but the context does not provide enough evidence to confirm this.
8. The statement might be false if the logic for data collection and analysis in case studies are different, but the context does not provide enough evidence to contradict this.
9. The statement is neutral because it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support its claim.
10. The statement is und
