<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can  mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend 
Statement: We have not done much gardening yet because of the rain. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context states that the speaker has noticed a major change in gardening and done a little bit on the patio, but it does not specify what the major change is or the extent of the work on the patio.
2. The context mentions waiting for the rain to subside to mow, but it does not explicitly say that the rain has prevented gardening activities.
3. The context states that they were able to mow this weekend after about a month, which could imply that they have been able to do some gardening during that time.
4. The statement is in the present perfect tense "have not done much" which implies that some gardening activities may have been done, but not a lot.
5. The context does not provide enough information to determine if the rain has caused a significant delay in gardening activities.</s>
