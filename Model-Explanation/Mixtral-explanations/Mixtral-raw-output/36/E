Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement implies that race is a factor in some judicial decisions, which aligns with the context.

3. The legal scholar Randall Kennedy explicitly states in his book that race is a factor in judicial decisions, supporting the statement.
4. The phrase "potentially the decisive factor" in the context implies that race can influence the outcome of a judicial decision, which is consistent with the statement.
