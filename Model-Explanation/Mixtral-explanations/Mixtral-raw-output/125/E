<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The woman rolled and drew two spears before the horse had rolled and broken the rest. 
Statement: They were in rotation on the ground grabbing their weapons. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The "woman" and "they" refer to the same person.
2. The "two spears" drawn by the woman are among the "weapons" being grabbed on the ground.
3. The "horse" is not one of the "they" who are grabbing their weapons.
4. The "rolling" of the horse and the woman are simultaneous or nearly simultaneous actions.
5. The "breaking" of the rest by the horse does not prevent the woman from rolling and drawing her weapons.
6. The "ground" is a shared location where both the woman and "they" are present.
7. The "weapons" being grabbed by "they" are already on the ground before being picked up.
8. The "rolling" of the woman and the horse is a form of movement, not a change in position of a physical object.
9. The "drawing" of the spears by the woman is a separate action from the "grabbing" of the weapons by "they".
10. The "rolling" of the woman and the "grabbing" of the weapons by "they" are not mutually exclusive actions.</s>
