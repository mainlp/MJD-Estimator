Context: and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer 
Statement: The cost of fixing it makes it hard to bring it to a dealer. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The cost of fixing the item is not a factor in bringing it to a dealer.
2. The cost of bringing the item to a dealer is low, but the cost of fixing it is high.
3. The cost of fixing the item is high, but it does not affect the decision to bring it to a dealer.
4. The item has been fixed before being brought to the dealer.
5. The cost of bringing the item to a dealer is already paid, and the high cost of fixing it is unrelated.
6. The item is not being brought to a dealer for reasons unrelated to its cost of repair.
7. The statement should be "The cost of bringing it to a dealer makes it hard to fix it," as the original context is about the cost of bringing it to a dealer, not the cost of fixing it.</s>
