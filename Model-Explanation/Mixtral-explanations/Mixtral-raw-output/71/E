<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: During his disastrous campaign in Russia, he found time in Moscow to draw up a new statute for the Com??die-Francaise (the national theater), which had been dissolved during the Revolution. 
Statement: Russia has been successfully invaded hundreds of times. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context mentions a "disastrous campaign in Russia," implying that an invasion or attack on Russia has occurred.
2. The individual in the context is able to spend time in Moscow drawing up a new statute, suggesting that the invasion was not so disruptive as to prevent this activity.
3. The fact that the Comédie-Française, a French national theater, is being reorganized in Moscow during the invasion suggests a level of stability and organization, which is not consistent with a highly destructive or disruptive invasion.
4. The statement does not specify that the invasion was successful in achieving its military or political objectives, only that it occurred.
5. The statement is a generalization about the number of times Russia has been invaded over a long period of history, and the context refers to a specific invasion during the Revolution, which may or may not be included in that total.</s>
