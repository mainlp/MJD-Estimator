Context: Mykonos has had a head start as far as diving is concerned because it was never banned here (after all, there are no ancient sites to protect).

Answer: [/INST] 1. Diving bans may be due to reasons other than protection of ancient sites, such as environmental conservation or safety concerns.
2. Mykonos may have other reasons for not banning diving, not just the absence of ancient sites.
3. The statement does not specify that diving bans in other places are solely due to protection of ancient sites.
4. There could be places with ancient sites where diving is not banned.
5. The statement assumes a causal relationship between ancient sites and diving bans, which may not always be the case.</s>
