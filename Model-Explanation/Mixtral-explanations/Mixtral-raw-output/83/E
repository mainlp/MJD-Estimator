<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: We did not study the reasons for these deviations specifically, but they likely result from the context in which federal CIOs operate. 
Statement: The Context in which federal CIOs operate is no different from other CIOs. 
Answer: [/INST] This statement is a contradiction to the context because:

1. The context states that deviations in the work of federal CIOs likely result from the unique context in which they operate, implying that there are differences between the context of federal CIOs and other CIOs.
2. The statement, however, claims that the context in which federal CIOs operate is no different from other CIOs, contradicting the information given in the context.
3. Therefore, the statement is not an entailment, as it goes against the information provided in the context.</s>
