<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Her state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering her memory." 
Statement: It is too bad that she never regained her memory. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The person in question never recovered her memory, meaning she remains in a state of amnesia.
2. The mental shock upon regaining her memory was so severe that it prevented her from experiencing any benefit of memory recovery.
3. The recovery of her memory was only temporary and she lost it again, leading to the current state of never having regained it.
4. The phrase "probably to be attributed" implies a causal relationship, suggesting that the mental shock occurred immediately after she regained her memory, and the context does not indicate any subsequent recovery of memory.
5. The statement could be expressing regret for the fact that she regained her memory only to suffer from the mental shock, and never had a chance to enjoy the benefits of memory recovery.</s>
