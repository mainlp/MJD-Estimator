<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Her state is probably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering her memory." 
Statement: It is too bad that she never regained her memory. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't specify when she failed to regain her memory. It could have been before or after the mental shock.
2. The context suggests that she has recovered her memory, implying that she did regain her memory at some point.
3. The word "probably" in the context indicates uncertainty, so it's undetermined if the mental shock was the direct cause of her state or if there are other factors involved.
4. The statement doesn't provide information about her current state, so it's undetermined if not regaining her memory has any impact on it.
5. The context only mentions one possible cause of her state (the mental shock), but there could be other reasons that are unrelated to her memory.
6. The intensity or nature of the mental shock is not specified, so it's undetermined if it's severe enough to prevent her from regaining her memory.
7. The context doesn't provide information about any attempts to help her regain her memory, so it's undetermined if these attempts were successful or not.</s>
