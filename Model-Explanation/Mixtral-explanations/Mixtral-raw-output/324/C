<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: NEH-supported exhibitions were distinguished by their elaborate wall panels--educational maps, photomurals, stenciled treatises--which competed with the objects themselves for space and attention. 
Statement: The exhibitions seem well-funded due to the elaborate detail of the gallery. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Lack of direct funding mention: The context does not explicitly state that NEH funding went towards the elaborateness of the exhibitions, only that they were distinctive for their detailed wall panels.
2. Elaborate wall panels vs. overall gallery: The statement refers to the "gallery" being elaborate, while the context specifies only the "wall panels" are elaborate.
3. Competing for space and attention: The context states that the elaborate wall panels competed with the objects for space and attention, which could imply inadequate funding.
4. Cause and effect: The statement assumes that elaborate details indicate good funding, but the context does not necessarily support this causal relationship.</s>
