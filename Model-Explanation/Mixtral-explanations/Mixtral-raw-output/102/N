<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: It is, as you see, highly magnified.  
Statement: It is plain for you to see that it is amplified. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The term "it" in the statement could refer to a different entity than in the context.
2. The context refers to magnification in a visual sense, while the statement uses the term "amplified" which could refer to sound or another non-visual form of magnification.
3. The degree of magnification in the context is not specified, so it's unclear if the level of amplification in the statement matches the context.
4. The context is open to interpretation, and the statement may be assuming a specific context that doesn't apply.
5. The statement may be using "plain for you to see" in an idiomatic sense, meaning obvious or clear, rather than literally visible.
6. The statement could be referring to a different type of amplification, such as emotional or conceptual, that doesn't apply to the context.
7. The context and statement may be using different scales or units of measurement for magnification or amplification, making a direct comparison impossible.
8. The context and statement may be describing different aspects of the same entity, making it unclear if they are in agreement or disagreement.
9. The statement could be assuming a shared understanding
