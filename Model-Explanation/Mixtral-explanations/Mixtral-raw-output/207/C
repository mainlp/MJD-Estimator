Context: Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any rate, some proof of identity. 
Statement: Identity should be a minimum requirement. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Identity is not required at all.
2. Only a password is needed, not proof of identity.
3. More than just identity is required, such as a password and additional verification.
4. Proof of identity is not considered as part of someone's identity.
5. The context refers to a specific situation where a password is required in addition to identity, not identity as a minimum requirement.</s>
