<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: Because marginal costs are very low, a newspaper price for preprints might be as low as 5 or 6 cents per piece. 
Statement: Many people consider these prices to be unfair to new printers. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. New printers have higher marginal costs compared to the stated low cost of preprint production.
2. The low prices make it difficult for new printers to cover their costs and make a profit.
3. The stated prices do not account for the expenses new printers incur when starting their business.
4. Existing newspaper companies can offer lower prices due to economies of scale, putting new printers at a disadvantage.
5. New printers may need to charge higher prices to remain competitive, causing tension with public expectations set by the low preprint prices.</s>
