<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The standard technology assumptions of scenario A were used by EIA in the development of the AEO2001 reference case projections. 
Statement: EIA used the standard technology assumptions to eliminate the AEO2001 reference case projections. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The term "eliminate" in the statement is ambiguous and could mean several things, such as discarding or removing the projections, which doesn't necessarily have to be done using technology assumptions.
2. The standard technology assumptions may have been used for creating the projections, but not necessarily for eliminating them.
3. The statement doesn't specify if the elimination of the projections was a direct result of using the standard technology assumptions.
4. The context only states that the standard technology assumptions were used in the development of the projections, but it doesn't specify if they were the only assumptions used.
5. The statement assumes that the standard technology assumptions were used to actively eliminate the projections, but it's also possible that they were used in a passive way, such as not updating the projections with new technology.
6. The context is about the AEO2001 reference case projections, but the statement doesn't specify if it's referring to the same projections.
7. The statement doesn't provide information on the method or criteria used to eliminate the projections, so it's impossible to determine if the standard technology assumptions were the cause.
