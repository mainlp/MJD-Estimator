Answer: [/INST] 1. EIA used the standard technology assumptions to improve, not eliminate, the AEO2001 reference case projections.
2. The standard technology assumptions were not used by EIA to eliminate but to adjust the AEO2001 reference case projections.
3. EIA did not use the standard technology assumptions to eliminate the AEO2001 reference case projections, but rather to validate them.
4. The standard technology assumptions were used by EIA in a way that did not result in the elimination of the AEO2001 reference case projections.
5. EIA used the standard technology assumptions to create new projections, not to eliminate the AEO2001 reference case projections.</s>
