<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The standard technology assumptions of scenario A were used by EIA in the development of the AEO2001 reference case projections. 
Statement: EIA used the standard technology assumptions to eliminate the AEO2001 reference case projections. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. EIA's use of standard technology assumptions led to the creation of the AEO2001 reference case projections, which were then chosen as the final or only projections.
2. The standard technology assumptions are associated with eliminating or excluding other technology assumptions, resulting in the AEO2001 reference case projections.
3. The standard technology assumptions directly influenced the elimination of alternative projections, leaving only the AEO2001 reference case projections.
4. EIA's adherence to standard technology assumptions resulted in the discarding of non-standard technology assumptions, leading to the AEO2001 reference case projections.
5. The standard technology assumptions are so restrictive that they inherently eliminate other possibilities, resulting in the AEO2001 reference case projections.
6. EIA's use of standard technology assumptions ensured that all other projections were disregarded, leaving only the AEO2001 reference case projections.

Note: The statement is not necessarily true given the context, as it could be interpreted in various ways. However, these are possible explanations for the statement being an entailment, assuming
