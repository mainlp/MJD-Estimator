<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The policy succeeded, and I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to make that contribution to my people. 
Statement: Because the policy was a success, I was able to make a contribution to my people. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't specify whether the contribution was directly due to the policy's success.
2. The context doesn't clarify if the contribution was made only because of the policy's success.
3. It's unclear if the success of the policy and the contribution are causally related.
4. The statement's "because" could imply a temporal relationship, not necessarily causation.
5. The speaker's "opportunity" in the context might not be equivalent to the policy's success in the statement.
6. The statement could be interpreted as the speaker's contribution being a result of other factors, not just the policy's success.
7. The context might suggest that the contribution was made during the policy implementation, but the statement could imply afterwards.
8. The statement could be interpreted as the speaker's contribution being a result of the policy's success, but not necessarily the cause.</s>
