<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: How effectively DOD manages these funds will determine whether it receives a good return on its investment. 
Statement: The DOD is certain to have a bad return on these funds. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement could be referring to a different set of funds that the DOD manages, not the ones mentioned in the context.
2. The context may be discussing only the potential for a good return, while the statement categorically asserts a bad return.
3. The word "effectively" in the context implies that there is room for variation in how well the DOD manages the funds, but the statement assumes the worst-case scenario.
4. The statement could be based on previous experiences or assumptions, while the context is focusing on the potential outcome of the current management.
5. The NLI system may not have enough information to determine the relationship between the context and the statement, as it depends on the specific criteria for a "good return" and how it relates to a "bad return".</s>
