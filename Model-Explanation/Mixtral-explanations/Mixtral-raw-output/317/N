<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The percent of total cost for each function included in the model and cost elasticity (with respect to volume) are shown in Table 1. 
Statement: Table 1 also shows a picture diagram for each function. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The table header may include a picture diagram, but the body of the table does not.
2. The term "picture diagram" could be interpreted differently, and the table may contain diagrams that are not considered "picture diagrams."
3. The table may contain links to picture diagrams instead of embedding them directly.
4. The table could be an interactive one where the picture diagrams are only visible upon user interaction.
5. The "picture diagram" might refer to an overall model diagram that is presented outside of the table.
6. The table may contain textual descriptions of the picture diagrams instead of the diagrams themselves.
7. The table might be incomplete or not fully loaded, resulting in the absence of picture diagrams.
8. There could be a formatting issue or a compatibility problem that prevents picture diagrams from being displayed in the table.
9. The person interpreting the statement and context might have different expectations about what constitutes a "picture diagram."
10. The statement could be a result of miscommunication or error, and there are indeed no picture diagrams associated with the table.</s>
