<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The percent of total cost for each function included in the model and cost elasticity (with respect to volume) are shown in Table 1. 
Statement: Table 1 also shows a picture diagram for each function. 
Answer: [/INST] I must clarify that the statement is not necessarily true based on the context provided. There is no information in the context that suggests a picture diagram for each function is included in Table 1. However, I can provide some possible explanations for how the statement could be true, even though they are not supported by the given context:

1. The table has a column for each function, and within that column, there is a picture diagram representing that function.
2. Alongside Table 1, there is a set of corresponding picture diagrams for each function, and they are clearly labeled and associated with the table.
3. The table has QR codes or hyperlinks within each function's row that lead to a picture diagram for that function.
4. The table has a separate page or section for each function, and the first page or section includes a text description while subsequent pages or sections include picture diagrams for that function.
5. The table is an interactive element, and when a user hovers over or clicks on a function, a picture diagram appears.

Please note that these explanations are hypothetical and not based on the given context.</s>
