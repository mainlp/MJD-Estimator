<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: So far, however, the number of mail pieces lost to alternative bill-paying methods is too small to have any material impact on First-Class volume. 
Statement: Occasionally mail is lost but not often 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context states that the number of mail pieces lost to alternative bill-paying methods is small.
2. The statement claims that mail is occasionally lost.
3. Therefore, the small number of lost mail pieces mentioned in the context could be the result of occasional losses.
4. The statement also mentions that the impact on First-Class volume is not material.
5. This implies that the occasional losses are not significant enough to affect the overall volume of mail.
6. Therefore, it can be inferred that mail is occasionally lost but not often to a significant extent that impacts the First-Class volume.</s>
