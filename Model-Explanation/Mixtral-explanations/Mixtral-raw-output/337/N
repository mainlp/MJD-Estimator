<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: So far, however, the number of mail pieces lost to alternative bill-paying methods is too small to have any material impact on First-Class volume. 
Statement: Occasionally mail is lost but not often 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context refers to mail pieces lost to alternative bill-paying methods, while the statement refers to mail being lost in general.
2. The statement "Occasionally mail is lost but not often" is subjective and does not provide a specific number or frequency of lost mail pieces.
3. The context states that the number of lost mail pieces is not yet material to First-Class volume, which may suggest that the frequency of lost mail is still low.
4. The statement does not specify whether the occasional loss of mail is due to alternative bill-paying methods or other reasons.
5. The context may suggest that the occasional loss of mail is expected and not a significant concern, while the statement implies that it is still noteworthy.</s>
