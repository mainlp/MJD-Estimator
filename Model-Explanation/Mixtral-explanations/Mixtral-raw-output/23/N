<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: The students' reaction was swift and contentious, as if their feelings had been hurt. 
Statement: The students reacted with horror. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context states that the students' reaction was contentious, not horrified.
2. The word "swift" in the context doesn't necessarily imply horror.
3. The feeling of being hurt (as suggested in the context) doesn't always lead to horror.
4. The context doesn't specify the cause of the students' reaction, which could influence the interpretation of horror.
5. The term "horror" may have different connotations for different people, and it's not explicitly mentioned in the context.
6. The reaction could involve a mix of emotions, not just horror.
7. The context doesn't provide enough information to confirm or rule out the presence of horror.
8. The author's intention may not be clear or may not include the concept of horror.
9. The students' reaction could be an overreaction, and the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm or deny this.
10. The context doesn't provide any visual or auditory descriptions that would support the interpretation of horror.</s>
