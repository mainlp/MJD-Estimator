<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is true (entailment) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In a six-year study, scientists fed dogs and other animals irradiated chicken and found no evidence of increased cancer or other toxic effects. 
Statement: Scientists gave animals irradiated chicken and they all lived as long as the rest of them. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The scientists did not find increased cancer or toxic effects in the animals that ate irradiated chicken, implying that their health was not negatively affected.
2. The animals, including those that ate irradiated chicken, lived as long as the others, suggesting that the irradiated chicken did not shorten their lifespan.
3. The lack of evidence for toxic effects indicates that the irradiated chicken did not cause any severe health issues that could have led to a shorter lifespan.
4. The animals' survival is comparable, which implies that the irradiated chicken did not have any long-term negative effects on their health or well-being.
5. Since there were no increased cancer or toxic effects, it is plausible that the animals' overall health was not compromised, enabling them to live as long as the others.</s>
