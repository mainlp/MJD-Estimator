<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: In a six-year study, scientists fed dogs and other animals irradiated chicken and found no evidence of increased cancer or other toxic effects. 
Statement: Scientists gave animals irradiated chicken and they all lived as long as the rest of them. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement doesn't specify what "all of them" refers to, it could mean all the animals in the study or just all the ones given irradiated chicken.
2. The statement doesn't provide information about the animals' quality of life or any other potential effects of the irradiated chicken.
3. The study did not compare the lifespan of animals given irradiated chicken to those given non-irradiated chicken.
4. The statement does not provide information about the types of animals included in the study, so it is unclear if the results can be generalized to all animals.
5. The study did not look at the long-term effects of consuming irradiated chicken over many generations.
6. The study did not consider the potential effects of irradiated chicken on different breeds of dogs or other animals.
7. The study did not look at the effects of irradiated chicken on animals with pre-existing health conditions.
8. The study did not consider the effects of irradiated chicken on animals at different life stages (e.g. puppies vs. adult dogs).
9. The study did not look at the effects of irradiated chicken
