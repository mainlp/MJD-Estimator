<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: All were prominent nationally known organizations. 
Statement: The only identified organizations were well-known. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions that the organizations are nationally known, while the statement claims that they are well-known. It's unclear if these two terms are synonymous in this context.
2. The statement could be referring to well-known organizations at a global or local level, while the context specifies national recognition.
3. The scope of organizations mentioned in the context might not cover all the organizations in the statement.
4. The statement doesn't clarify if the organizations are well-known in a specific domain or field, whereas the context refers to general prominence.
5. The context doesn't indicate if the organizations are exclusively prominent, leaving room for other potentially less known organizations to be part of the group.
6. The statement doesn't explicitly state that all prominent organizations are well-known, leaving room for the possibility that some prominent organizations are not well-known.</s>
