<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is false (contradiction) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white 
Statement: It took over a day to paint the house 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The house's interior was mostly already white, so only a portion of the house needed painting.
2. Only one wall and its trim were painted, not the entire house.
3. The dark trim was left unpainted, so the painting process was not extensive.
4. Newer houses typically have white molding, which suggests that the house was not significantly changed in terms of color.
5. The painting process was interrupted, but the speaker cannot recall the specifics.</s>
