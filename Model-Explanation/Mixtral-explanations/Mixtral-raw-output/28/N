<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: He jumped up, planting one hand on the charging horse, and came at the brute with the axe. 
Statement: He swung at the brute with his sword. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The text does not specify the type of weapon the person is carrying, only that it's an axe.
2. The word "brute" in the context could refer to a person or an animal, and the statement assumes it's an animal.
3. The statement implies that the person switched weapons, but the context does not provide information to confirm this.
4. The context describes a specific action ("came at the brute with the axe"), but the statement describes a different action.
5. The statement could be true if the person had both an axe and a sword, but the context does not provide information to confirm this.</s>
