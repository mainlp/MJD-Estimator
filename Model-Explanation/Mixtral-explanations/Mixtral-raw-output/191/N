<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: will never be doused (Brit Hume, Fox News Sunday ; Tony Blankley, Late Edition ; Robert Novak, Capital Gang ; Tucker Carlson, The McLaughlin Group ). The middle way is best expressed by Howard Kurtz (NBC's Meet the Press )--he scolds Brill for undisclosed campaign contributions and for overstretching his legal case against Kenneth Starr but applauds him for casting light on the media. 
Statement: They wanted the public to know where the funds came from. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The statement does not specify who "they" refers to, and it could be a group not including the individuals mentioned in the context.
2. The statement does not indicate whether the public knowing where the funds came from would lead to the situation where the fire of criticism will never be doused or not.
3. The statement does not specify which funds are being referred to, and it could be a different set of funds than those at issue in the context.
4. The statement does not indicate whether the funds in question were disclosed or not, and it could be that they were disclosed, which would not align with the context.
5. The statement does not specify the motivation behind wanting the public to know where the funds came from, and it could be for a reason unrelated to the media criticism discussed in the context.
6. The statement does not specify the timing of when the funds were to be disclosed, and it could be that they were disclosed before or after the events discussed in the context.
7. The statement does not specify the extent to which the funds were to be disclosed, and it could be that only partial disclosure was intended, which would not align with the context.
