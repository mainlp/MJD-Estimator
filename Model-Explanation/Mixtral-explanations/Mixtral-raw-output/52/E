5. The explorer named the village as a tribute to someone else, not himself.
6. The name of the explorer is not Sainte-Marie.
7. The village was renamed at some point after the explorer's initial visit, so it is no longer named after him.
8. The explorer did not officially name the village, but rather the name was already in use by the local inhabitants.
9. The explorer named the village in consultation with local inhabitants, and they chose a name unrelated to him.
10. The explorer named the village as a result of a misunderstanding or miscommunication with local inhabitants, and the name does not actually refer to him.
