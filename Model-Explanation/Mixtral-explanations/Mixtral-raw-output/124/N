<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: well they're so close to an undefeated undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation 
Statement: Unless they suffer any losses, they'll remain motivated. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. The context only mentions the team's desire for an undefeated season and their motivation, but it does not explicitly state that there are no upcoming games or potential losses.
2. The statement assumes that the team's motivation is solely dependent on their chance at an undefeated season, while the context implies other possible motivations such as making history.
3. The context might be implying that the team's motivation is already at a high level, but the statement introduces uncertainty by suggesting that their motivation is conditional upon not suffering any losses.
4. The context does not provide information about any potential challenges or setbacks the team might face, making it unclear if those factors could affect their motivation.
5. The context does not specify if the team's motivation is consistent or subject to change, leaving the statement's assumption of motivation being tied to an undefeated season undetermined.</s>
