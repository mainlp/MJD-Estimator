<s> [INST] You are an expert in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Please list all possible explanations why the the following statement is undetermined (neutral) given the context below without introductory phrases. 
Context: 3 It should be noted that the toxicity (LC50) of a sample observed in a range-finding test may be significantly different from the toxicity observed in the follow-up chronic definitive test  (1) the definitive test is longer; and (2) the test may be performed with a sample collected at a different time, and possibly differing significantly in the level of toxicity. 
Statement: The toxicity of a sample in the range-finding test will be exactly the same as the toxicity in the follow-up test. 
Answer: [/INST] 1. Different duration of the definitive test.
2. Sample collection time variation.
3. Potential differences in toxicity levels over time.
4. No mention of consistent toxicity levels in the statement.
5. LC50 values could vary between tests.
6. The initial sample may naturally change in toxicity over time.
7. No guarantee of identical toxicity in the two tests.
8. The statement does not account for possible variations in test conditions.
9. The statement's claim is not supported by the context.
10. The context highlights the potential for different toxicity levels.
11. The two tests may not use the same methodology or conditions.
12. The toxicity of the sample could be affected by external factors.
13. The statement assumes a strict equality, which is unlikely in real-world scenarios.
14. The context implies that toxicity levels could change, making the statement undetermined.
15. The statement does not account for any potential experimental errors or variations.</s>
